Most Illinoisans   however   are not required to pay dues to the union . Though he has chosen not to join AFSCME   Janus is nonetheless required under Illinois law to pay fees to the union that represents state workers . He would like to stop doing so   rather than support positions and activities that conflict with his views . And the U . S . Supreme Court   which heard oral arguments in the case Monday   looks inclined to let him . Those state employees who decline to join the union are exempt from that portion of dues that go to finance its political action . But they are forced to pay “ fair share ” fees that supposedly reflect the benefit they get from the union ’ s collective bargaining . The rationale is that if workers could opt out of any payments   those doing so would be “ free riders ”: They would reap the pay and conditions the union negotiates — while paying members bear the union ’ s costs . There are obvious problems with AFSCME ’ s argument for compulsory fees . The first is that the union has the discretion to decide what counts as political spending and what doesn ’ t . Janus ’ lawyers note that these claims “ turn   to a large degree   on self - interested judgments by union officials about how they and other union employees spend their time .” More basic   though   is that when a union negotiates on behalf of public workers   everything it does is inherently political . When AFSCME pushes for higher wages or changes in work rules   it is putting itself on one side of a political issue . In a parallel case from California two years ago    Chief Justice John Roberts  asked the lawyer for the state to name a topic of collective bargaining that has nothing to do with such matters . When  he  cited “ mileage reimbursements  ”  Roberts  disagreed : “ It ’ s all money . If you give more mileage expenses ( to teachers )  the amount that ’ s going to be allocated to public education as opposed to public housing   welfare benefits — that ’ s always a public policy issue .” Mandatory fees require dissenting nonmembers to support beliefs they reject . But the right of free speech   as the court long has recognized   includes the freedom not to speak . To force someone to pay for the advancement of political positions without his or her consent is incompatible with the First Amendment . Union officials say losing the revenue from compelled payments would weaken their negotiating power . But they also fear losing   yes   political power . AFSCME ’ s Naomi Walker has warned that a loss in this case “ could undermine political operations that assist the Democratic Party ” and damage “ the progressive infrastructure in this country   from think tanks to advocacy organizations .” But why should the needs of union - aligned groups take precedence over Janus ’ right to decide which causes to financially support ?

What if Illinois law required certain workers to contribute to groups that provide useful services but also donate heavily to Republican causes ? Writing in the Tribune two years ago   Janus argued   “ Government unions have pushed for government spending that made the state ’ s fiscal situation worse', 'How is that good for the people of the state ? Or   for that matter   my fellow union members who face the threat of layoffs or their pension funds someday running dry ?” For Janus to win   the court would probably have to overrule a  decision that upheld such fees', 'The justices came close in the  California case   shortly after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia   deadlocking  -', 'The addition of conservative Neil Gorsuch seems likely to provide the deciding vote for the reversal here', 'In    the Supreme Court said that “ except in perhaps the rarest of circumstances   no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support', '” This case is a chance for the justices to say : And we mean it', ""Why I don ' t want to pay union dues » Why am I paying union dues when the union won ’ t protect me from sexual harassment ?

Now   the real question is how are people defining those values for themselves today ? Are they defining them in the context that the founders had   or are people redefining them to the point where they see someone else as an enemy of those values ?” People exist now in their own bubbles of isolation   where it ’ s much easier for folks to peg others as enemies because “ we ’ re only listening to things   finding things and sharing things that only substantiate what we already believe  ” Kicklighter said . To break out of these bubbles   the duo believe   the majority of Americans need to agree and adhere to a baseline of values they think are the same as those of their neighbors . “ The American Question ” is that wake - up call to the country   said Seemann — a “ cautionary tale ” to the masses to not regress   but to progress .

3389,dev,"What Went Wrong In Charlottesville ? Almost Everything   Says Report Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Updated at  :  p . m . ET An independent review of Charlottesville ' s handling of the white nationalist rally there in August found that law enforcement and city officials made several significant mistakes   resulting in violence and distrust . The city commissioned the report   which was prepared by  Timothy Heaphy    a former U . S . attorney in Virginia . In conducting the investigation    Heaphy  said  his  team pored through hundreds of thousands of documents   interviewed hundreds of witnesses   and reviewed countless hours of video and audio . The resulting  - page report is a detailed record of the chaos and conflict that unspooled in the Virginia college town . It is unsparing in identifying the errors authorities made that day and in the preceding months . The city failed to protect either free expression or public safety   the report finds : "" This represents a failure of one of government ' s core functions — the protection of fundamental rights . Law enforcement also failed to maintain order and protect citizens from harm   injury   and death . Charlottesville preserved neither of those principles on August    which has led to deep distrust of government within this community ."" The "" most tragic manifestation "" of the failure to protect public safety was the death of  - year - old Heather Heyer   the report says . "" Early on August    CPD had placed a school resource officer alone at the intersection of  Street NE and Market Street  "" the report explains . "" This officer feared for her safety as groups of angry Alt - Right protesters and counter - protesters streamed by her as they left Emancipation Park . The officer called for assistance and was relieved of her post . Unfortunately   CPD commanders did not replace her or make other arrangements to prevent traffic from traveling across the Downtown Mall on  Street ."" All that remained to impede traffic was a single wooden sawhorse . "" This vulnerability was exposed when James Fields drove his vehicle down the unprotected street into a large crowd of counter - protesters at the intersection of  Street SE and Water Street   killing Ms . Heyer  "" it says . The report praised the city ' s fire department and the University of Virginia Health System for their quick response to victims of the car attack   calling it "" a bright success on a day largely filled with failure ."" Some of the problems identified in the report echo the criticism of law enforcement response at the time ; some are new revelations . Among the mistakes : Attempts in the days before the protest to move the event to a different location meant that law enforcement had to plan for two scenarios . Charlottesville Police and Virginia State Police did not sufficiently coordinate their plans . On August    their officers could not communicate over the radio with one another because they were on different channels . Police did not adequately separate conflicting groups   which led to physical altercations . Police commanders instructed their officers not to intervene in all but the most serious physical confrontations . They prepared to respond to violence by declaring an unlawful assembly and dispersing the crowd . Once unlawful assembly was declared   police efforts to disperse the crowd generated more violence   as conflicting groups were pushed toward each other . Officers remained behind barricades in relatively empty areas   rather than being stationed along crucial routes as protesters and counterprotesters shifted and clashed . Tactical gear wasn ' t accessible when officers needed it . Charlottesville Police received inaccurate information from Commonwealth ' s Attorney Dave Chapman regarding the legality of restricting weapons other than firearms . Chapman told police they could not restrict other weapons   when in fact the city could have prohibited bats   poles and shields . In a statement to NPR   Charlottesville City Manager Maurice Jones said that the city does "" not agree with every aspect of the report ' s findings  "" but it is thankful for the work of the reviewers . "" We faced an unprecedented series of protests and demonstrations this summer   culminating with the Unite the Right Rally on August   "" Jones said . "" On a number of fronts   as the report acknowledges   we succeeded in protecting our City to the best of our abilities . But in other areas we   and our law enforcement partner in the Virginia State Police   undoubtedly fell short of expectations   and for that we are profoundly sorry . This report is one critical step in helping this community heal and move forward after suffering through this summer of hate ."" Police Chief Al Thomas Jr . released a statement saying   "" My hope now is that   as we move forward ... we can learn from the productive elements of this report   work together to address our shortcomings and recommit ourselves to serving the public in a way that gives our citizens the utmost confidence in their safety and wellbeing ."" After documenting what went wrong   the report also had a number of recommendations for Charlottesville and other municipalities that need to prepare for similar "" mass unrest events ."" Among Heaphy ' s recommendations :","['What Went Wrong In Charlottesville ?

In conducting the investigation    Heaphy  said  his  team pored through hundreds of thousands of documents   interviewed hundreds of witnesses   and reviewed countless hours of video and audio . The resulting  - page report is a detailed record of the chaos and conflict that unspooled in the Virginia college town . It is unsparing in identifying the errors authorities made that day and in the preceding months . The city failed to protect either free expression or public safety   the report finds : "" This represents a failure of one of government \' s core functions — the protection of fundamental rights . Law enforcement also failed to maintain order and protect citizens from harm   injury   and death . Charlottesville preserved neither of those principles on August    which has led to deep distrust of government within this community ."" The "" most tragic manifestation "" of the failure to protect public safety was the death of  - year - old Heather Heyer   the report says . "" Early on August    CPD had placed a school resource officer alone at the intersection of  Street NE and Market Street  "" the report explains . "" This officer feared for her safety as groups of angry Alt - Right protesters and counter - protesters streamed by her as they left Emancipation Park . The officer called for assistance and was relieved of her post . Unfortunately   CPD commanders did not replace her or make other arrangements to prevent traffic from traveling across the Downtown Mall on  Street ."" All that remained to impede traffic was a single wooden sawhorse . "" This vulnerability was exposed when James Fields drove his vehicle down the unprotected street into a large crowd of counter - protesters at the intersection of  Street SE and Water Street   killing Ms . Heyer  "" it says . The report praised the city \' s fire department and the University of Virginia Health System for their quick response to victims of the car attack   calling it "" a bright success on a day largely filled with failure ."" Some of the problems identified in the report echo the criticism of law enforcement response at the time ; some are new revelations . Among the mistakes : Attempts in the days before the protest to move the event to a different location meant that law enforcement had to plan for two scenarios . Charlottesville Police and Virginia State Police did not sufficiently coordinate their plans . On August    their officers could not communicate over the radio with one another because they were on different channels . Police did not adequately separate conflicting groups   which led to physical altercations . Police commanders instructed their officers not to intervene in all but the most serious physical confrontations . They prepared to respond to violence by declaring an unlawful assembly and dispersing the crowd . Once unlawful assembly was declared   police efforts to disperse the crowd generated more violence   as conflicting groups were pushed toward each other . Officers remained behind barricades in relatively empty areas   rather than being stationed along crucial routes as protesters and counterprotesters shifted and clashed . Tactical gear wasn \' t accessible when officers needed it . Charlottesville Police received inaccurate information from Commonwealth \' s Attorney Dave Chapman regarding the legality of restricting weapons other than firearms . Chapman told police they could not restrict other weapons   when in fact the city could have prohibited bats   poles and shields . In a statement to NPR   Charlottesville City Manager Maurice Jones said that the city does "" not agree with every aspect of the report \' s findings  "" but it is thankful for the work of the reviewers . "" We faced an unprecedented series of protests and demonstrations this summer   culminating with the Unite the Right Rally on August   "" Jones said . "" On a number of fronts   as the report acknowledges   we succeeded in protecting our City to the best of our abilities . But in other areas we   and our law enforcement partner in the Virginia State Police   undoubtedly fell short of expectations   and for that we are profoundly sorry . This report is one critical step in helping this community heal and move forward after suffering through this summer of hate ."" Police Chief Al Thomas Jr . released a statement saying   "" My hope now is that   as we move forward ... we can learn from the productive elements of this report   work together to address our shortcomings and recommit ourselves to serving the public in a way that gives our citizens the utmost confidence in their safety and wellbeing ."" After documenting what went wrong   the report also had a number of recommendations for Charlottesville and other municipalities that need to prepare for similar "" mass unrest events .""

ROBERT SIEGEL   HOST : A new type of volunteer opportunity has taken off in New York City .

BETH FERTIG   BYLINE : On a recent weekday morning   Marissa Lohse is gathering her troops in a coffeeshop in lower Manhattan . LOHSE : Perfect   perfect . FERTIG : Lohse is with the New Sanctuary Coalition . It ' s a network of congregations and individuals who accompany immigrants facing deportation to the Federal Building   which is just down the street .  Jean Hale  is a first - time volunteer .  She  doesn ' t know what to expect .  HALE  : I think it may be just emotional support and perhaps a big hug . FERTIG :  Hale  says  she  ' s horrified by the Trump administration ' s aggressive enforcement of immigration laws .  She  ' s    a retired English as a Second Language teacher . The volunteer program took off in  during a previous crackdown under former President Obama . But Lohse - herself an immigrant from Argentina - says it ' s now bigger than ever . Several hundred volunteers came forward after Trump took office . A lot are retirees like her . They call the immigrants   friends . LOHSE : Before   I was just going by myself with a friend . Now it ' s just   thank God we have so many volunteers . So I do it   and I cry when I think about it . FERTIG : There ' s a lot on the line . These volunteers are joining people at immigration court hearings to determine whether they can stay in the country . Others are bringing them to check - ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Many undocumented immigrants were allowed to stay as long as they regularly met with ICE . These check - ins used to be routine . Now   some immigrants are detained without any warning . Lohse has seen that firsthand . LOHSE : I ' ve been one time when I was with a wife of a guy . Then   the ICE agent came out with a pair of glasses and a wallet . Your husband wants you to have this . They didn ' t give a chance for her to say goodbye . FERTIG : This type of volunteering is not easy . It ' s emotional   and the issues are thorny . At a training session   volunteers are told all immigrants deserve support   even those who have committed crimes . That gave one man pause . ED STUBIN : I can accept that the criminal justice system isn ' t always right   but I ' m troubled having to go with some people that I don ' t think should be on this earth   much less in this country . FERTIG : That ' s Ed Stubin   a business owner who says his father was an immigrant . He decides he will volunteer   however   when a coordinator assures him that immigrants who commit serious crimes are usually held in detention . On the day of the coffeehouse meeting   about  volunteers are joining eight immigrants . One of those immigrants is Inez   a young mother seeking asylum who doesn ' t want us using her full name . She ' s got her  - year - old son with her   and she ' s grateful to have six of the volunteers going with her to immigration court . INEZ : ( Foreign language spoken ).

3396,dev,The head of the U . S . Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark  rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape .  FCC chief Ajit Pai   a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January    said the commission will vote at a Dec .  meeting on  his  plan to rescind the so - called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities . The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content . They were intended to ensure a free and open internet   give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content . The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT & T Inc   Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price . It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc   which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules . Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “ roll back these core protections .” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners   the move is all but certain to be approved . Trump   a Republican   expressed his opposition to net neutrality in  before the regulations were even implemented   calling it a “ power grab ” by Obama . The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday .  Pai  said  his  proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “ inherently an interstate service .” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic - governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers ’ equal access to internet content . “ The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro - competitive  ”  Pai  said in an interview   adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “ heavy - handed ” regulation of the internet . “ We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses  ”  Pai  added . Tom Wheeler   who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules   called the planned repeal “ a shameful sham and sellout . Even for this FCC and its leadership   this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights .” AT & T   Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing . Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “ not block   throttle   or discriminate against lawful content .” ‘ HEAVY COSTS ’ Verizon said it believed the FCC “ will reinstate a framework that protects consumers ’ access to the open internet   without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation .” Ajit Pai   Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission   testifies before a Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington   U . S .  June     . REUTERS / Aaron P . Bernstein The Internet Association   representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook   said Pai ’ s proposal “ represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans .” “ This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans ’ ability to access the entire internet  ” it said . Pai ’ s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so - called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content . Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency   the Federal Trade Commission   to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers   Pai said . The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “ anticompetitive ” or violated antitrust rules . The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February     . REUTERS / Yuri Gripas The FCC received more than  million comments . New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments . A U . S . appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations   which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom . The group praised Pai ’ s decision to remove “ antiquated   restrictive regulations ” to “ pave the way for broadband network investment   expansion and upgrades .” The FCC ’ s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality . Nancy Pelosi   the top U . S . House of Representatives Democrat   said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition   saying the agency “ has launched an all - out assault on the entrepreneurship   innovation and competition at the heart of the internet .” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January . Trump has abandoned international trade deals   the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections   taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba   and sought repeal Obama ’ s signature healthcare law . Pai   who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman   is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda . Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials . The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies . Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web . The FCC granted initial approval to Pai ’ s plan in May   but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct . His plan would eliminate the “ internet conduct standard  ” which gave the FCC far - reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices .,['The head of the U . S .

In cases when the misconduct is so severe that the Justice Department cannot drop charges   the guidelines will still allow companies that come forward to get a  percent reduction of the lowest level of penalty .

 His  comments came while discussing negotiations that already have been made between Pelosi  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D-New York  and President Donald Trump on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

3414,dev,"If you bought a Bitcoin in early   when one cost less than $  you could have a profit of more than   percent now. But you almost certainly didn’t do that. Perhaps you dipped in a toe in November or December  as the price hit headline-grabbing records—$   then $   then higher. If you were very unlucky and bought at the peak of about $  on Dec.   you’d have lost more than  percent of your money as of Jan.   when the price was $ . More than $  of that decline came in about  hours  after South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon indicated the country may crack down on cryptocurrency trading to discourage speculation. It’s not every asset that can feel like it’s in a bubble and a crash at the same time.
But based on no other valuation metric than what it cost a year ago  the price of  Bitcoin  is still dizzyingly high. For the many doubters who can’t believe things have come this far—and for  Bitcoin  owners who can see how much they might lose—the big question is what it would take to knock the price back further.
In past episodes  “ Bitcoin  and digital currencies have been incredibly resilient to bad news ” says Meltem Demirors  director of development at Digital Currency Group  which invests in  Bitcoin  and related technologies. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Mt. Gox  Bitfinex  and BTC-e have been hacked over the years  with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of  Bitcoin  stolen. China in September moved to shut down exchange trading of the cryptocurrency. None of these permanently stopped  Bitcoin ’s rise up the price charts  especially after  it  drew the attention of hedge fund traders and futures markets.
One doomsday scenario would be a successful hack of the blockchain. That’s the underlying technology that records and verifies every transaction  using exact copies of a database spread on computers all over the world. Those host computers  called miners  are rewarded with new Bitcoin for doing the work of verifying transactions. An attacker might be able to alter the blockchain’s history by marshaling more than half the computing power on the network. But that would be monumentally difficult; someone with the technology to do it could instead “opt into the game” and get paid to mine Bitcoin  says Tyler Winklevoss  co-founder of the Gemini digital asset exchange and one of the largest  Bitcoin  holders.
The likelier risks are far more pedestrian. The first is that while plenty of investors and speculators have piled into  Bitcoin    it ’s a difficult currency to use in the real world. The network is slow and expensive for small transactions. And who wants to spend $ in  Bitcoin  for a coffee if next week that could be worth $? “My big concern as a company is that digital currency doesn’t find its quote-unquote killer use cases  where people are saying  ‘Wow  we now have tens of millions of daily active users that are using it for payments ’ ” says Adam White  who runs GDAX  the exchange for institutional investors run by Coinbase. “That’s one of the largest existential threats to the company.”
There’s been a very public civil war among  Bitcoin  developers: One group favors changes to the network  the other doesn’t. “It’s got to have the developer community come together and figure out how to scale it properly and continuously ” says Sheri Kaiserman  a managing director at Wedbush Securities and an early Wall Street believer in  Bitcoin ’s potential. Meanwhile   Bitcoin  faces competition from other digital currencies  from Bitcoin Cash to Litecoin to Ether  which have also seen big gains and wild swings.
You could spend weeks learning about the nuances of the various cryptocurrencies. But the main risk to  Bitcoin  is actually the easiest to understand. “The biggest factor in what’s driving the price up is potentially what will drive it down—a reversal of animal spirits ” says Adam Ludwin  chief executive officer of blockchain startup Chain. “There is essentially a belief this will continue to go up. If people believe it will continue to go down  that’s self-reinforcing.”
To explain that psychology  Ludwin invokes John Maynard Keynes. The economist likened investing to a newspaper contest where readers were asked to pick the picture of the person the majority of other people would find most attractive. To win  a reader would have to discard his own judgment and bet purely on a guess of what the average person would find beautiful. Or  maddeningly  even on what the other players would think the average player would like. Cryptocurrency in general is “really one of the most beautiful distillations of the Keynesian beauty contest that’s ever existed ” says Ludwin. All investments have some of this speculative element  but unlike  say  a stock   Bitcoin  isn’t a claim on future earnings to which investors can hitch a valuation. To bet on  Bitcoin  is to believe simply that others will want  it .
One read on the psychology of  the Bitcoin boom  is that  it ’s part of a broad bull market in all kinds of assets. Despite anxieties about politics  North Korea  and rising equity valuations  investors seem to be in a mood to embrace risk and are fearful of missing out on big gains. Or perhaps  Bitcoin  is the shadow side of that optimism: Many are drawn to cryptocurrency because they see  it  as a palliative to the system that came crashing down in   and their belief in  Bitcoin  has been hard to shake. Market psychology is difficult to pin down—the one thing that’s reliable about it is its volatility.","['If you bought a Bitcoin in early   when one cost less than $  you could have a profit of more than   percent now.

Reporter Ronan Farrow said he was told by  women of alleged assault or harassment during the magazine's -month investigation. Others  including actresses Mira Sorvino and Rosanna Arquette  told the magazine they believe they were removed from projects and their careers suffered after rejecting  Weinstein 's advances.
A spokesperson for the beleaguered movie executive told The New Yorker: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by  Mr. Weinstein .""
"" Mr. Weinstein  has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.  Mr. Weinstein  obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations  but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record   Mr. Weinstein  believes that all of these relationships were consensual "" according to the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson. "" Mr. Weinstein  has begun counseling  has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.  Mr. Weinstein  is hoping that  if  he  makes enough progress   he  will be given a second chance.”
Farrow's reporting in the magazine is also supported with a recording obtained from a New York Police Department sting operation from  involving  Weinstein  and Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.
In the recording  the model asked  Weinstein  why  he  had groped her breasts the day before.  He  replied  ""Oh  please  I’m sorry  just come on in. I’m used to that. Come on. Please "" according to the magazine.
As the recording continues   Weinstein  tries to convince her to come into  his  hotel room while  he  showers  despite her protests. After a nearly -minute encounter   he  agrees to let Gutierrez leave.
The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office decided not to file charges after a two-week investigation and  Weinstein  was never prosecuted. Gutierrez subsequently signed a highly-restrictive nondisclosure agreement with  Weinstein   The New Yorker reported  including an ""affidavit stating that the acts  Weinstein  admits to in the recording never happened.""
The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office told ABC News in statement today  ""If we could have prosecuted  Harvey Weinstein  for the conduct that occurred in   we would have.  Mr. Weinstein’s  pattern of mistreating women  as recounted in recent reports  is disgraceful and shocks the conscience.""
The New Yorker report was published two days after  Weinstein  was terminated by the company which bears his name.

3427,dev,"Paul Manafort  Rick Gates Back In Court For Bail Negotiations
 Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a former top aide Rick Gates  were in court again on Monday to negotiate a bail agreement. The two have been confined to  their  homes since pleading not guilty to charges stemming from the Russia investigation.
Two of President Trump's former campaign aides were back in court today   former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy  Rick Gates .  They  face money laundering and other charges as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. NPR's Ryan Lucas was in the courtroom earlier today  and he's with us now. And Ryan   Manafort  and Gates were indicted at the end of October. Why were they back in court today?
RYAN LUCAS  BYLINE: Well  today's hearing touched on a number of things. And there's one significant matter that is still being worked out  and that is a bail package for  Manafort . It's kind of weird that it's taken so long. Today the judge had questions about the assessed values of some of the real estate that  Manafort 's defense team has put forward in their proposed bail package.
Just over a week ago  it looked like  Manafort  had reached an agreement with the special counsel's office on a bail deal that would get him out of home confinement. A few days later  the special counsel's team says  hold on. You know  we've changed our mind. The reason for this  they said  was that  Manafort  was anonymously co-authoring an editorial with a Russian associate with ties - alleged ties to Russia's intelligence services.
SIEGEL: Let's focus on that for a moment. You're saying that after he was indicted   Manafort  has been in contact with someone who's linked to a Russian spy service. What more can you tell us about that?
LUCAS: Well  it is pretty weird  yes. There's - a quick reminder basically about what this is all about. So prosecutors say that  Manafort  helped ghost write an English-language op-ed for a Ukrainian newspaper. The editorial portrayed him in a favorable light. And Manafort's associates in Ukraine say that  Manafort  didn't really have much of a role in this. But in court papers that prosecutors filed on Friday  they provided an exhibit that showed specific changes that they say  Manafort  made to the draft. And they have the times that those changes were made.
Now  there are a host of problems with  Manafort 's actions according to prosecutors  but the big one is that it was a violation of the judge's gag order not to try the case in the press  in the public sphere. And for prosecutors  they also say that it raises questions about  you know  trust when it comes to his bail. Now  today Manafort's attorney defended the op-ed and said that since it was for a Ukrainian newspaper  it's not a big deal. Manafort's not on trial in Ukraine. He said Manafort's reputation is under attack in the press and that Manafort was just trying to set the record straight.","['Paul Manafort  Rick Gates Back In Court For Bail Negotiations', "" Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a former top aide Rick Gates  were in court again on Monday to negotiate a bail agreement.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian highway police on Wednesday detained  Cesare Battisti   an Italian former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in  his  country  as  he  was attempting to cross the border into Bolivia in a taxi  federal police said.
 Battisti  was apparently trying to leave Brazil after Italy reportedly asked Brazil’s government to revoke  his  asylum status and extradite  him  to serve  his  prison sentence.
 He  was stopped by highway police as  he  was about to cross the border in a Bolivian taxi and was held for possession of a “significant” quantity of undeclared foreign currency  the federal police said in a statement.
 Battisti  faced life in prison in Italy  where  he  was convicted of four murders committed in the   when  he  belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism.  He  escaped from prison in  and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy.
 Battisti ’s lawyer  Igor Sant‘Anna  told Reuters that he had sought a habeas corpus injunction last week due to the risk that President Michel Temer’s government could agree to Italy’s request. Habeas corpus is a legal procedure that keeps a government from holding a person without showing cause.","['Italian former leftist guerrilla Cesare Battisti  leaves the headquarters of Federal Police in Sao Paulo March   .

But  she  didn't have cancer.  She  had an obscure syndrome called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome  a condition only recently acknowledged by the medical community. It affects a small population namely  a subset of marijuana users who smoke multiple times a day for months  years or even decades.
One surefire sign of the illness is when patients find relief in hot showers and baths.  Queen  said  she  would vomit repeatedly unless  she  was in a hot shower so  she 'd stay in there for hours.

3430,dev,"-- Many of my stadium visits have dovetailed with fruitful reporting trips. I watched the Reds play in Cincinnati last fall after spending an afternoon with  Trump  supporters drinking $ beers in Middletown  Ohio. Several independent voters told me at PNC Park in Pittsburgh last September that they voted for Bill Clinton both times  but they couldn’t get behind Hillary Clinton. On election night  I flashed back to both of those experiences as I set out to explain what happened.
An expected rule by the  Trump  administration to limit the ACA's contraception coverage mandate will fulfill a crucial promise  Donald Trump  made as a candidate to appeal to social conservatives. (Photodisc)
-- The  Trump  administration is expected to announce today a major rollback of the ACA’s contraception coverage mandate. William Wan and Juliet Eilperin report: “The action … will allow a much broader group of employers and insurers to exempt themselves from covering contraceptives such as birth control pills on religious or moral grounds. It represents the latest twist in a seesawing legal and ideological fight that has surrounded this aspect of the  health-care law nearly from the start. … The action by the Trump administration is almost certain to spark fresh litigation. The National Women’s Law Center — which estimates that in  alone  the contraception requirement saved women $. billion in oral contraceptive costs — has vowed to challenge the administration in court.”
-- Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the White House “welcomed” the NRA’s position  adding that  Trump  wants to be part of the “conversation” about cracking down on the devices.
--  Trump  is slated to announce next week that  he  will “decertify” the nuclear deal with Iran  saying it is “not in the national interest” before punting the issue to Congress. Anne Gearan and Karoun Demirjian report: “The move would mark the first step in a process that could eventually result in the resumption of U.S. sanctions against Iran … But  Trump  would hold off on recommending that Congress reimpose sanctions  which would constitute a clearer break from the pact The decision would amount to a middle ground of sorts between  Trump   who has long wanted to withdraw from the agreement completely  and many congressional leaders and senior diplomatic  military and national-security advisers  who believe the deal is worth preserving with changes if possible.  Trump  is expected to deliver a speech  tentatively scheduled for Oct.   laying out a larger strategy for confronting the nation  he  blames for terrorism and instability throughout the Middle East. … Officials cautioned that plans could still change”
-- During an event with senior military leaders last night   Trump  cryptically said  “You know what this represents. Maybe it's the calm before the storm.” Pressed by reporters on what “the storm” meant  the president would only say  “You'll find out.”
--  Trump ’s decision on the deal could cause a “major breach” with European allies. Karen DeYoung and Carol Morello report: ““After the Paris climate decision … this could push multilateralism to the breaking point ’ said a senior official from one of the three European signatories to the Iran deal. None of the three — Britain  France and Germany — believes Iran is in violation  and each has said publicly it will not renegotiate the nuclear agreement. U.S. imposition of sanctions affecting banks that even indirectly do business in Iran would doubtless influence those countries’ companies  they say  and would be considered an unfriendly act.”
-- Robert Mueller’s team met this summer with “Russia dossier” author and former MI- officer Christopher Steele. CNN’s Evan Perez  Shimon Prokupecz and Pamela Brown report: “The intelligence agencies  particularly the CIA  and the FBI took Steele's research seriously enough that they kept it out of a publicly-released January report on Russian meddling in the election in order to not divulge which parts of the dossier they had corroborated and how. This contrasts with attempts by  and some lawmakers to discredit Steele and the memos  ”
In addition to trying to cut funding for the ACA  the  Trump  administration also is hampering state efforts to control premiums. (Andrew Harnik/AP)
--  Trump  supporters’ low-dollar donations to the RNC have given the GOP a huge financial advantage over the Democrats and could fundamentally change the party. Matea Gold reports: “In giving to support  Trump   his backers are pouring tens of millions of dollars into the coffers of the   which has raised more from small-dollar contributions at this point in the election cycle than the national party has collected in more than a decade. …  has pulled in nearly twice as much as its Democratic counterpart this year. “
--  Trump  personally intervened this summer to stop GOP lawmakers in Iowa from attempting to revitalize the state’s ACA exchange. Juliet Eilperin reports: “ Trump  read about the request in a newspaper story and called the federal director weighing the application.  Trump ’s message in late August was clear … Tell Iowa no. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act see the president’s opposition even to changes sought by conservative states as part of a broader campaign by his administration to undermine the  health-care law.”
-- The administration plans to propose cutting legal immigration in half over the next decade in exchange for a DACA replacement. Politico’s Josh Dawsey  Andrew Restuccia and Matthew Nussbaum report: “The principles would likely be a political non-starter for Democrats and infuriate Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi …  was upset after  Trump’s  dinner last month with Schumer and Pelosi and has been working since to bring the president back to the tougher stance he took during his campaign.""
-- The administration told the Supreme Court yesterday that it should not consider  Trump ’s previous travel ban  which has now been replaced. Robert Barnes reports: “Opponents of the ban  who had persuaded two appeals courts to block the executive order  said the court should continue to review the cases. Even if not  they said  the lower-court rulings should stand. The justices asked for the new briefing about whether the issue was moot since  announced a replacement travel ban last month. The court canceled an oral argument on the issue scheduled for next week. … Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said the new proclamation means that temporary measures under review at the Supreme Court have been superseded.”
--  Trump  is expected to scrap the Obama-era Clean Power Plan by arguing that  his  predecessor’s proposal to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions overstepped legal boundaries. Brady Dennis reports: “In a copy of the proposed repeal  first reported by Bloomberg News  the EPA does not offer an alternative plan for regulating emissions of carbon dioxide  which the Supreme Court has ruled that the agency is obligated to do. Rather  the agency said it plans to seek public input on how best to cut emissions from natural-gas and coal-fired power plants.”
--  Trump  also plans to nominate coal lobbyist Andrew R. Wheeler  who has ties to climate change deniers  to serve as the EPA’s second-in-command. (The New York Times’s Lisa Friedman)
-- Meanwhile  the Secret Service has spent at least $  on golf cart rentals to protect  Trump  this year during the time spent at  his  private clubs in New Jersey and Florida. USA Today’s Julia Fair reports: “According to federal purchase orders … the agency paid $  in a Sept.  contract to rent golf carts at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida. That's the biggest purchase order for golf carts so far . . . The agency signed contracts for golf carts at  Trump 's clubs as early as February  but they never exceeded about $ .”","['-- Many of my stadium visits have dovetailed with fruitful reporting trips.

3434,dev,"When President Barack Obama goes to Guadalajara  Mexico  this weekend  for the North American Leaders Summit  he will surely praise Mexican President Felipe Calderon  for the courage he has displayed fighting the war on drugs. The applause is well deserved. Calderon has turned the crackdown on drug traffickers into the centerpiece of his administration and has pursued organized crime with undeniable zeal. But before Obama becomes too effusive and pats CalderonCalderon  on the back for a job well done  it's important that the U.S. president remember the cost and the consequences of his counterpart's crusade.
In light of this  U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy  D-Vt.  was right this week  to call ""premature""  the U.S. State Department's draft report claiming that Mexico has fulfilled its human rights obligations under the so-called Merida Initiative. He is right to remind officials on both sides of the border that in return for Merida's   $. billion in counter-narcotics aid from the United States  the Calderon government made promises it has not kept. Key among these are greater transparency and accountability  and the imperative that military officers be tried by civilian courts.
Time and again  Calderon has resisted these demands  adopting an increasingly contradictory stance. Calderon stands with his hand outstretched  asking the U.S. for more support and involvement in the war on drugs. But he also obstinately defends military exceptionalism regarding the justice system  decries U.S. intervention in Mexico's internal affairs and rallies Mexico's political class under the banner of a politically expedient anti-Americanism.
So unless the Obama administration insists that those requirements be met  the Merida Initiative will simply be financing impunity. It will heighten the climate of fear that deeper binational collaboration sought to eradicate. It will allow the Mexican military and police forces to do what they do now: arbitrarily detain people  kill innocent bystanders at army checkpoints  threaten and abuse alleged suspects  ignore due process while carrying out arrests and get away with it because Calderon believes they can and should. In his view  the ends justify the means. As he defiantly stated in a recent interview: ""The worst human rights abuses are those committed by the drug traffickers.""
Unfortunately  Calderon's stance will undermine the cause he so valiantly espouses. Military abuses that go unsanctioned are weakening public support for the war on drugs and making it difficult to construct the rule of law in a country where it functions intermittently.
Until Mexico makes real progress where human rights are concerned  the U.S. Congress should withhold future funding for the Merida Initiative. Unless Calderon agrees to place military officials who violate human rights under the jurisdiction of civilian courts  U.S. support will perpetuate the status quo.","[""When President Barack Obama goes to Guadalajara  Mexico  this weekend  for the North American Leaders Summit  he will surely praise Mexican President Felipe Calderon  for the courage he has displayed fighting the war on drugs.

 An FBI-led joint terrorism task force based in the southern United States has been investigating Muhammad since he returned to the United States from Yemen  a law enforcement official said. The suspect had been arrested and jailed in Yemen at some point for using a Somali passport  the official said. The time of that arrest was not immediately clear.
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Pat Harris said no decision has been made on whether to pursue federal charges against Muhammad. ""We're consulting with a lot of people on what  if any  charges can be filed against him "" Harris said.
 Police Sgt. Cassandra Davis said Tuesday it wasn't known when Muhammad began planning the attack.
 Deputy Prosecutor Scott Duncan said Muhammad told investigators that ""he would have killed more soldiers had they been in the parking lot."" Long and Ezeagwula were targeted as they stood outside the recruiting center smoking cigarettes.
 Muhammad did not speak during the brief hearing before Judge Alice Lightle.
 John Rehrauer  spokesman for the Pulaski County jail  said the department was handling Muhammad as it does other high-profile cases.
 ""He is in some protective custody  in a higher-security unit in a cell by himself "" Rehrauer said.
 He said he didn't know of any threats against Muhammad and said jailers did not believe he was in any greater danger than previous high-profile people handled at the prison.
 A police report said Muhammad told investigators he observed two soldiers in uniform  drove up to the recruiting center and began shooting.
 ""He saw them standing there and drove up and shot them "" Lt. Terry Hastings told The Associated Press. ""That's what he said.""
 Police arrested Muhammad along a highway moments after the shootings. Police said an assault rifle and other weapons were found in his vehicle.

 Shaw said that over his years as an assistant  and a player alongside Bryant  he's noticed how a ""pecking order"" emerges in the Lakers offense with Bryant as the top option  and too often the only option.
 ""We tell our guys to start the offense away from him "" Shaw said.
 ""Use this side of the court  see your options over here; if nothing's there  reverse it to him and now the shot clock's down and let him do his thing. But when he's out there on the floor and he's doing his little signals asking for the ball  there's kind of a pecking order that happens out there on the court.
 ""They don't want to piss him off  and they want to please the coaching staff as well. But he's the closest one to them on the floor. So a lot of times they'll force the ball into him with three people around him instead of making the right play.""
 The only player on the Lakers who consistently does what the offense dictates is Derek Fisher  Shaw said  with too many younger players deferring to Bryant's commands.
 ""Some of the younger guys  they just want to make him happy "" Shaw said. ""When I played  Shaq was the second ... there were two dominant players. So if we went away from Kobe and threw it in to Shaq  what can he say? Now  who is that guy that's on the same level that he's on? If they make a play over here to Lamar (Odom) or somebody else and Kobe gets mad  then they're going to play more to that because nobody's on that same level.""
 Well  how about a certain -foot tall Spaniard? ""Pau (Gasol) doesn't have the demeanor "" Shaw said. ""He's a nice guy. Shaq might've been like  'Give me the ball.' And Kobe might've been like  'Give me the ball.' If you give it to Shaq  it's OK. If you give it to Pau and it doesn't work out  then Kobe might get on you. That's just something the players have to work out.""
 Shaw did not intend his remarks to come off as critical of Bryant  merely explanatory. It's a blessing-and-curse issue the Lakers' coaching staff has gladly dealt with for years  only sometimes finding answers.
 In the past couple of years  Shaw said  Bryant and coach Phil Jackson have developed a level of trust where Jackson is OK with Bryant calling plays on his own or deviating from what Jackson has drawn up.
 Shaw said the coaching staff can only do so much in that regard. That it's up to his teammates to be more assertive and confident in their reads and reactions to Bryant for things to evolve to the next level.
 If his teammates hang back  Bryant will push into the void. Even if he's tired.

 Little more than a week before he begins the defence of his Australian Open title  Nadal also let slip a - final set lead  and retreated into more defensive and containing patterns which contributed significantly to the courageous Davydenko revival.
 Australian Open title  Nadal also let slip a - final set lead  and retreated into more defensive and containing patterns which contributed significantly to the courageous Davydenko revival.
 ""Maybe I needed to be a bit more calm "" Nadal said about the second match point which got away. ""But probably that's because I have not won a tournament for so many months.""
 ""In this tournament I came back to play my best tennis for a long time "" claimed Nadal  making the best of his disappointment.
 ""Anyway I lost today (Saturday). He played unbelievable tennis - he was just better.""
 During that phase the Russian began uncertainly  Nadal imposed a flatter- hitting  earlier-taken  more enterprising attack which he had been employing previously this week  and had romped through seven games without reply.
 When Davydenko began to play more as he had against Roger Federer in the semi- finals  taking the initiative wherever possible  hitting stridently and if necessary finishing the rally in the forecourt  Nadal fought back aggressively from - down  and looked odds on to close the match out in the tie-break.
 On one of his match points  at -  Davydenko played just too well  but on the second  at -  Nadal earned himself a relatively pressure-free hit on the forehand from inside the baseline - and unaccountably put it into the net.
 Once he had also let slip an early break of serve in the final set  Nadal's lack of confidence  born from injury  a long sequence without a title  and doubts about his future  began to reveal itself.
 He retreated more often into what he knew best - the style in which he contains his opponent's attacks from several feet behind the baseline  relying on mobility  tenacity  and change-of-paced winners from counter-hitting positions.
 It made the man who has become known as Mr Invisible for having so low a public profile only the second player to beat both Federer and Nadal in the same tournament twice - the other is David Nalbandian of Argentina.
 It also raised the question  now that he has his  title  including the ATP World Tour Masters in London at the end of the  season  whether he can also take away Nadal's Australian Open title.","[""Nadal failed to convert two second set match points in a -  - (/)  - loss to Nikolay Davydenko - known as 'Mr Invisible' - which will once again raise the question whether he has the confidence to fight his way back to the pinnacle."", ' Little more than a week before he begins the defence of his Australian Open title  Nadal also let slip a - final set lead  and retreated into more defensive and containing patterns which contributed significantly to the courageous Davydenko revival.', ' Australian Open title  Nadal also let slip a - final set lead  and retreated into more defensive and containing patterns which contributed significantly to the courageous Davydenko revival.', ' ""Maybe I needed to be a bit more calm "" Nadal said about the second match point which got away.

Pipes that should last  years are in some cases rupturing in their very first year  according to Hendrix and some state documents. This can lead to explosions  leaks  fires and other dangers.
 Hendrix said he uncovered the problem after he was asked to oversee the certification of a new manufacturing process that put the pipes through a prescribed battery of tests. He concluded that JM Eagle had been selling substandard plastic pipe since   and that it had subsequently manipulated test results.
 When he told his superiors of his concerns  they said the problems were a normal ""business risk "" according to the complaint. When he pressed harder  he was fired.
 He said he believed that Hendrix had ""cherry-picked"" testing documents and e-mail messages to give the impression that the company had been not followed proper testing procedures. Some of the requirements were ambiguous  he said  and Hendrix was interpreting them so strictly ""no manufacturer could have met that standard."" Galindo said JM Eagle had worked with the relevant industrial associations to clarify the ambiguous language.
 If Hendrix's allegations are borne out  it is not clear who will pay to repair the faulty water systems.
 Hendrix said in his complaint that after Walter Wang became chief executive in   many of the longtimers resigned or retired  and people who had minimal backgrounds in engineering or failure analysis replaced them.
 JM Eagle also put a premium on cutting costs  Hendrix said  hiring people like him straight out of college. It even maintained a boarding house near Livingston for Taiwanese employees who could not afford suburban New York housing on their modest salaries.
 One of his first jobs was to field customer complaints  which he said came in at the rate of at least one a day. He said he was trained to look for ways to attribute leaks and ruptures to the governments and contractors who installed and maintained the pipes.
 Only when he was assigned to oversee certain tests did Hendrix begin to think the complaints stemmed from the company's own cost-cutting measures. He said he realized JM Eagle had started buying a lower grade of raw materials from Formosa and had speeded up its production lines without reporting the changes to the certification agencies as required.

3453,dev,"Gordon has made a career of what are known as wage-and-hour cases. That may sound dry  but the issues involved strike at the heart of the relationship between employees - particularly low-income employees - and the people they work for. As Gordon explains it  this a population that is often at the mercy of the people they work for. The benefits at stake here are typically small - two hours of overtime here  a lunch break there - but they add up.
 He entered the Wal-Mart suit earlier this year. Mills Law Firm  a law firm based in California  had been appointed by the court to represent the plaintiffs. Mills is one of the nation's preeminent class-action law firms but needed local counsel. Gordon became that counsel  the lawyer on the ground in Boston.
 That the case has taken eight years to resolve speaks to the difficulty of suing a behemoth. Though Gordon was not at liberty to talk about Wal-Mart specifically  he talked generally about the difficulty of suing a big company.
 ""They have so many resources "" he said. ""If you need records  like timecards that prove how much your client worked  they have the records. If you need to talk to a manager who can explain what went on  the manager works for them. They can tie up cases  knowing that employees have no resources and need lawyers who can take cases on contingency "" meaning they get paid only if they win the case.
 Asks Gordon: ""How many lawyers can afford to do that?""
 Gordon refers to the settlement as a ""mini-stimulus"" for the affected workers  who will receive an average of $. ""It's direct assistance - cash - to people who really  really need it.""
 He argues that the settlement will be good for low-wage workers  whose employers will be less likely to exploit them  and to employers. Law-abiding employers  he said  will no longer have to compete against companies that derive an unfair advantage by underpaying their workers.
 Gordon delivers this message  like many of his statements  with something approaching messianic zeal. He is David battling Goliath  and this case is proof that sometimes David can win.

3456,dev,"After losing in straight sets to No.  Rafael Nadal on yet another semi-miserable  windblown night in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday  Verdasco walked away more impressed by the conditions -- and by Roger Federer -- than anything Nadal did.
 Nadal wasn't so bad in them either  overcoming his first dropped service game of the tournament to scrub out eighth-seeded Verdasco -  -  - in the first all-Spanish quarterfinal in U.S. Open history.
 Like Federer  Nadal has yet to lose a single set in five matches at Flushing Meadows  and handles bad conditions well.
 In advancing to his third straight U.S. Open semifinal  Nadal improved to - lifetime against Verdasco -- victories scored around the world  on almost every kind of surface and in almost every kind of weather. But when it was over  Verdasco sounded less overwhelmed by his opponent than depressed that he didn't get Nadal on a better night.
 ""For the game I need to beat Rafa  these conditions was very bad for me "" he said.
 Meanwhile  told of Verdasco's early handicapping  Nadal took no offense.
 ""Well  for sure Roger is the favorite of the tournament  especially because he's won five times "" Nadal said. ""And six finals in a row. No one doubts on that one. And I am in the semifinals  so I don't think about the final. Everybody free to think  and what Fernando says is completely fair.""
 Indeed  there is still some business to be completed before the dream final -- a pairing that has taken place at every Grand Slam final except the U.S. Open. (Nadal is - in those meetings.)
 Nadal's next opponent will be Mikhail Youzhny  who defeated Stanislas Wawrinka -  - ()  -  -  - in a contest Thursday afternoon that featured  unforced errors. Youzhny made his second U.S. Open semifinal with a performance that  frankly  he'll need to pump up if he's going to pull off an upset against the world's top player.
 Nadal was the fourth and final man to punch his ticket to the semifinals  even as he dropped serve in the first set -- the first time he was broken in the tournament following  consecutive holds.
 Not to worry. Five games later  Verdasco double-faulted on the last two points to give the break back  then Nadal got another one to avoid the tiebreaker and close out the set  -. He got a break in each of the next sets to close out what will go down as a routine victory  nothing like their epic  five-set  -hour semifinal at the  Australian Open.
 ""When I had the chance  I tried to play hard and go to the net to close the point "" Verdasco said. ""But when I had these balls  the ball was moving all the time and it was impossible to play the game that I think I need to try to have chances to beat Rafa.""
 After his win over Robin Soderling on Wednesday  Federer said he liked playing in wind because of the challenge it provides.
 ""The movements must be all the time high intensity and the concentration must be all the time full "" he said. ""So probably both those things are one of the best things about my game.""","['After losing in straight sets to No.  Rafael Nadal on yet another semi-miserable  windblown night in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday  Verdasco walked away more impressed by the conditions -- and by Roger Federer -- than anything Nadal did.', "" Nadal wasn't so bad in them either  overcoming his first dropped service game of the tournament to scrub out eighth-seeded Verdasco -  -  - in the first all-Spanish quarterfinal in U.S. Open history."", ' Like Federer  Nadal has yet to lose a single set in five matches at Flushing Meadows  and handles bad conditions well.', "" In advancing to his third straight U.S. Open semifinal  Nadal improved to - lifetime against Verdasco -- victories scored around the world  on almost every kind of surface and in almost every kind of weather.

3462,dev,"Having just wrapped up a visit to China on the eve of the Shanghai World Expo's opening  Liu shared his views on urban planning and what an ideal city is about.
 The -year-old Liu was an architect-planner and chief executive of Singapore's Housing and Development Board and chief planner and chief executive of Urban Redevelopment Authority. He is currently the director of RSP Architects Planners
 For Liu  fundamentals are  first and foremost  the pre- requisite to building a modern ideal city. Aesthetic architecture  on the other hand  is a feather on the cap  and one should not place the bull before the cart.
 Liu said ""An ideal city should have a pleasant environment  smooth traffic  pollution free and be an ideal dwelling where the people own their own houses. These are the fundamentals that must be put in place. Other distinguishing buildings such as sports stadiums  integrated resorts belong to the class of sexy things."" Liu added that while residents are interested in ""sexy"" things  and the government will hold them up as a scorecard for political credits  the basic things are what the people will experience daily.
 Taking Singapore as an example  Liu said that in the first  years of nation building for Singapore  it was through sheer grit  with the aim of building up an infrastructure. In the early days  foreign experts commented that Singapore is as boring as a hospital. ""I told my colleagues not to listen to them!"" Liu reminisced  ""Our city is not Disneyland  we will continue with our own way  and they will regret what they say.""
 He said that people who visit Singapore these days say that the city is beautiful and that the architecture is full of characteristics. This is not true. ""Buildings with high creative value are few and far between in Singapore. They are only good in the matter of planning and design requirements.""
 ""I tell my Chinese friends  to be good in urban planning  fundamentals are crucial. If this is lacking  sexiness is superficial. For China  tidiness is a characteristic. If every house has its own characteristic  it will become a mess "" Liu said.
 For Liu  he felt that many modern cities are getting bigger in scale and the buildings are taller. Big cities need to build skyscrapers mainly because the cities are big  the land tension is great and prices are high. This is necessary in order to meet the need of residents' housing and employment requirement. But the problem arises when a city starts building sky-high buildings regardless of the size of the city.
 Liu believed that every city has its own identity. He likens a big city to a tycoon  a mid-tier city a professor  and a small city a village girl. For the different identities  different personalities must be portrayed and hence  different strokes applied to city planning.
 Liu Thai-Ker said that Shanghai builds tall buildings due to many pressures. But a small city should make a Shanghainese envious  exuding a carefree  relaxed and romantic environment and feel.
 He said that there can be three major types of characteristics to a city: natural environment  historical monuments and modern buildings. ""Modern buildings are faceless  their structures globalized  materials globalized  and it is hard to break out of the globalized confines no matter what one does. To focus the local flavor on modern buildings is to be devoid of characteristics."" He felt that some old dilapidated traditional architecture in China should be accorded their deserving respect as they represent the true cultural essence.
 Liu Thai-Ker emphasized that developing the economy and improving the environment are not mutually exclusive. Using the Singapore experience as an illustration  he said that protecting the natural environment will not impede economic development. When the environment improves  many people would willingly stay here  which in turn generate many employment opportunities  thereby fostering economic development.
 ""(Environmental conservation) is a task that can be done  and it is a worthwhile effort!"" he claimed.
 Besides  he felt that while advancing the development of cities  China must at the same time pay attention to the environmental development of the towns and villages. After all  the local flavor can only be found in the towns and villages.","[""Having just wrapped up a visit to China on the eve of the Shanghai World Expo's opening  Liu shared his views on urban planning and what an ideal city is about."", "" The -year-old Liu was an architect-planner and chief executive of Singapore's Housing and Development Board and chief planner and chief executive of Urban Redevelopment Authority.

“One of the loveliest sounds in the world ”  Hefner  said decades later.
It was there  during the Great Depression  that  Hefner ’s extraordinary life took shape — not so much because of what happened there  but what didn’t: Affection. Emotion. Love. And certainly not sex  although his parents did manage to have two children.
The rules of the home were strict — no swearing  no drinking  no playing cards  no radio on Sundays — and reflected the Puritan upbringing of  Hefner ’s parents  who grew up on Nebraska farms. His father  Glenn  was an accountant at an aluminum company. His mother  Grace  was a school teacher.
Grace was sexually demure to a degree notable even for that time  Gay Talese wrote in “Thy Neighbor’s Wife ” his bestselling book about sex in America  which chronicled  Hefner ’s rise. As for Glenn  he was “a remote  repressed man who seldom revealed his feelings to his family and spent most of his time working quietly… six days a week  sometimes seven.”
 Hefner  was “unattractive and shy ” Talese wrote  and he often slipped away from the present even though he was right there:
If the boys became restless indoors  they were permitted to sit at the workbench in the backyard where they could draw pictures or sculpt with the colored clay that  she  provided.  Hugh Hefner   who was facile in drawing and sculpturing  was more than diverted by these activities—he often seemed entranced by the clay figures of his creation  relating to  them  with a special intimacy  and if at such times his mother called to him from the back door  he would not hear her.
Though  Hefner  was bright he did not excel in school  often sitting at his desk and drawing cartoons for hours.  Hefner  seemed so totally disengaged that teachers wondered if he could hear them. Not knowing what to do  Grace had him examined by child psychologists at the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research.

That being said  I think offensive coordinator John Morton was too conservative with  Petty . He is a skilled deep passer. I think the Jets need to let him throw it downfield more and take advantage of his ability to make plays with his arm instead of relying on him to make good reads and accurate short throws.

Well   he  didn’t do anything to me.
That  in so many words  is what three dozen women who worked on “Saturday Night Live” said in a letter supporting Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) on Tuesday.
“What  Al  did was stupid and foolish  and we think it was appropriate for  him  to apologize to Ms Tweeden  and to the public ” the women wrote. And later  “We would like to acknowledge that not one of us ever experienced any inappropriate behavior; and mention our sincere appreciation that  he  treated each of us with the utmost respect and regard.”
Good  I guess?  Franken  has been accused of unwanted sexual contact by two women  including radio host Leeann Tweeden  but apparently  he  refrained from groping at least . Though this character testimony may at first seem relevant to any accounting of  Franken ’s misdeeds  look closer and it’s not the least bit helpful.
It’s unclear what the letter seeks to prove. (The writers  at least  acknowledge that  Franken  mistreated Tweeden.) The number of women a man didn’t assault does not matter if there are others he did. There are plenty of people the Zodiac Killer did not murder.
Saturday Night Live briefly criticizes  Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn .)  a former writer and star of the show on Nov.   as he faces sexual misconduct allegations. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)
Refocusing attention on what  Franken  did right just distracts from what  he  did wrong. It also assumes a harasser abusing everyone  he  comes into contact with is the norm. That paints an inaccurate picture of workplace harassment  and it lowers the bar for behavior by suggesting that a bad man isn’t so bad after all if he’s only bad to some people.
“Sincere appreciation”? “Gratitude”? The letter-writers are thanking  Franken  for not groping them  instead of insisting that women should be able to take a grope-free atmosphere for granted.
The  Franken  letter isn’t the first time we’ve seen women speak up not to support women but to stand behind a man accused of harming women. Lena Dunham got hit hard over the weekend after she and a “Girls” co-writer mounted a similar defense of one of their colleagues accused of assault.
Dunham’s defense was worse; she claimed the accusation against her friend was “one of the  percent of assault cases that are misreported every year.” But she based that claim on “having worked closely with him for more than a decade.” Dunham  in other words  thought her friend was a good guy  just as  Franken ’s defenders from “SNL” see  him  as “a devoted and dedicated family man” and “an honorable public servant.”","['According to a CNN report filed on Nov.   a second woman has accused  Sen.

3472,dev,"A Chicago police officer who faces potential firing for fatally shooting two people in   has been charged with misdemeanor offenses following an off-duty bar fight last month.
 Officer Robert Rialmo  turned  himself  in to a police station Monday and was arrested on two counts of battery and one count of theft  all misdemeanors  said Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.  He  was released on  his  own recognizance  department officials said.
 Rialmo  is alleged to have punched two men in the face  knocking them to the floor  about : a.m. Dec.  at Moretti's Ristorante & Pizzeria on the Far Northwest Side  according to police reports and Guglielmi. By the time police arrived at the scene   Rialmo  was gone  the spokesman said.
 Rialmo’s  lawyer  Joel Brodsky  said video of the altercation — which has yet to be made public — shows that the officer was defending himself against “highly intoxicated aggressors.” Brodsky also denied  Rialmo  stole the jacket.
Top department officials stripped  Rialmo  of his police powers days after the bar incident.
At the time of the alleged fight   Rialmo  was already on paid desk duty pending an investigation into his fatal shooting of Quintonio LeGrier    and bystander Bettie Jones    the day after Christmas  on the West Side. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability ruled five days after the tavern incident that the shooting was unjustified.
LeGrier came at  Rialmo  and his partner with an aluminum baseball bat in his hand as the officers responded to a call of a domestic disturbance.  Rialmo  shot the teen and accidentally hit Jones  a neighbor standing nearby.
But COPA voiced skepticism about  Rialmo ’s account of the confrontation  determining that the teen likely was further from  Rialmo  when he opened fire than the officer had said. Investigators also concluded that LeGrier likely did not swing the bat at  the Rialmo   as the officer had contended.
COPA recommended that  Rialmo  be fired for the shooting  but Superintendent Eddie Johnson still has months to decide what  if any  discipline he might seek from the Chicago Police Board.
Brodsky and police union officials have decried the ruling and vowed to challenge it. The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police has accused COPA of using the alleged bar fight to pressure Johnson to seek  Rialmo ’s firing in the shooting.
Jones  who lived downstairs  answered the door and pointed police to the second floor. LeGrier then came down the stairs with a bat  according to an analysis released by Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office  which declined to bring criminal charges against  Rialmo  last February.
The officers moved toward the front landing as LeGrier came at them with the bat  prosecutors wrote. As  Rialmo  backed down the stairs  he fired eight times  hitting LeGrier six times  according to prosecutors. Jones  who was standing behind the teen  was shot once in the chest.
Brodsky has said his client was justified in firing in self-defense  but COPA investigators voiced doubts about  Rialmo 's accounts. COPA found that no one corroborated the officer's contention that LeGrier swung the bat  while investigators concluded that the evidence suggested that  Rialmo  was several feet farther from the teen when  he  opened fire than the officer had said.
The survivors of both LeGrier and Jones sued  Rialmo  and the city.  Rialmo   meanwhile  took the unusual step of suing the city  alleging in part that he was inadequately trained.  Rialmo  is also suing LeGrier's estate  blaming the teen for the shooting and contending it emotionally traumatized the officer.","['A Chicago police officer who faces potential firing for fatally shooting two people in   has been charged with misdemeanor offenses following an off-duty bar fight last month.', ' Officer Robert Rialmo  turned  himself  in to a police station Monday and was arrested on two counts of battery and one count of theft  all misdemeanors  said Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

3474,dev,"On the eve of the original name-drawing Wednesday  Democratic candidate Shelly Simonds filed  a court motion contesting a previous decision to count a contested ballot for her opponent  Republican incumbent David Yancey .
 The court  has yet to address the matter  as some of  its  judges are out of town for the holidays.
The turmoil over the seat has dragged on for more than a month. A recount originally proclaimed Simonds the winner by a mere one vote.  Yancey  then won a lawsuit that allowed a previously uncounted ballot to be counted as marked for  him  ― bringing the race to a tie.
Virginia House Democrats have called  Yancey ’s lawsuit a “desperate effort to change the outcome and steal the election” from Simonds.

In a verdict posted on its official Weibo microblog on Tuesday morning  the Changsha Intermediate People’s Court said the lawyer   Jiang  Tianyong  developed notions of overthrowing China’s political system after being influenced by training workshops held by “anti-China foreign forces” overseas.
The court said  Jiang     used social media to “attack or defame” Chinese government departments and incited others to gather and demonstrate in public.
 Jiang ’s wife  Jin Bianling  who lives in the United States  told Reuters on Tuesday that the verdict was “unacceptable” and that she believed her husband was being made an example to “deter or repress” other rights lawyers.
“I do not acknowledge or accept this verdict ” she said in a telephone interview. “Jiang Tianyong is innocent”.
The verdict was handed down exactly one year after  Jiang  first disappeared last November while visiting the family of another detained rights lawyer.  He  was held incommunicado for six months before being formally charged.
The facts in the court’s ruling were broadly similar to those in a confession made by  Jiang  during  his  trial in August. Video footage of  Jiang  reading parts of a written statement were released by the court via social media at the time.
But rights groups said the trial was a show trial designed to discredit  him  and that  Jiang  was caught up in a sweeping campaign directed against lawyers and activists.
Jin said  Jiang ’s family was unable to appoint their own lawyers and that she had not been able to contact  Jiang  since  his  detention.
“We don’t know what  his  conditions are inside  or what kind of torture of mistreatment  he  has suffered ” she said.","['FILE PHOTO: Pro-democracy demonstrators hold up portraits of  Chinese disbarred lawyer Jiang Tianyong   demanding  his  release  during a demonstration outside the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong  China December   .

3481,dev,"Former Fox News primetime host  Bill O'Reilly  settled a sexual harassment claim in January for a record $ million.
One month later  Fox News' parent company   Century Fox  renewed  O'Reilly 's contract  giving  him  a four-year deal with a $ million annual salary.
 Century Fox executive Rupert Murdoch and his sons decided to stand by  O'Reilly  despite the mounting allegations against  him .
 Former Fox News headliner Bill O'Reilly  settled a new sexual harassment claim for a record $ million in January  The New York Times reported on Saturday.
One month after  O'Reilly  settled the claim — which was at least the sixth agreement that had been reached relating to  O'Reilly 's sexual misconduct — Fox News' parent company   Century Fox  renewed the host's contract with the network and agreed to a four-year deal with a $ million annual salary.
 The company  said in a statement that  it  was not aware of the amount of  O'Reilly 's settlement with Wiehl and saw the dispute as a personal issue between the two.
According to the Times   Century Fox executives Rupert Murdoch and his sons  James and Lachlan  decided to back up  O'Reilly  in January despite the mounting allegations against  him . That decision hinged on two factors: limiting the negative publicity that a second sexual harassment scandal — coming as the network grappled with fallout from the allegations against former chairman Roger Ailes — would bring  and Megyn Kelly's announcement that she would be leaving the network after signing a multi-year contract with NBC.
 O'Reilly 's $ million agreement with Wiehl is the largest known amount paid out to settle a sexual misconduct claim at Fox News  according to the Times. The closest figure to that amount is the $ million former host Gretchen Carlson received when she accused Ailes of sexual harassment in .
 O'Reilly 's lawyer disputed Wiehl's characterization of their relationship and said the host's relationship with the network analyst was an -year friendship during which she sometimes gave him legal counsel.
Mark Fabiani   O'Reilly 's spokesman  said regarding Wiehl's allegations of a nonconsensual sexual relationship that  Century Fox was ""well aware"" Wiehl had signed an affidavit ""renouncing all allegations"" against  O'Reilly  and that after the agreement was reached  Fox News offered  O'Reilly  ""a record breaking contract "" per The Times.
 O'Reilly  told the Times on Wednesday that none of the allegations against him held any merit. ""I never mistreated anyone ""  O'Reilly  said  and reiterated that  he  had reached settlements with  his  accusers because  he  wanted to shield  his  children from the repercussions and publicity surrounding the issue.
""It's politically and financially motivated ""  O'Reilly  told the Times  referring to the backlash that followed after the initial allegations against  him  were made public in April. ""We can prove it with shocking information  but I'm not going to sit here in a courtroom for a year and a half and let my kids get beaten up every single day of their lives by a tabloid press that would sit there  and you know it ""  he  said.
 O'Reilly  was ultimately ousted from the network in April  following an exodus of advertisers from  his  show's time slot. Earlier that month  the Times published an investigation that found that  O'Reilly  and Fox News had paid out $ million to five women to settle sexual-harassment claims they had brought against  him .
Multiple other women accused  O'Reilly  of sexual harassment after the report was published. Shortly before  O'Reilly  was booted  an unnamed black woman said through her attorney  Lisa Bloom  that  O'Reilly  leered at her and called her ""hot chocolate"" in . Bloom is also representing Wendy Walsh  a former Fox News contributor who has said that  O'Reilly  reneged on an offer of employment after  she  rebuffed  his  advances and declined an invitation to  his  hotel suite in .
""After a thorough and careful review of the allegations  the Company and  Bill O'Reilly  have agreed that  Bill O'Reilly  will not be returning to the Fox News Channel ""  Century Fox  the parent company of Fox News  said in the statement in April.
In an internal memo obtained by Business Insider  Murdoch and his sons  Lachlan and James  said that ""after a thorough and careful review of allegations against him  the company and  Bill O'Reilly  have agreed that  Mr. O'Reilly  will not return to the Fox News Channel.","[""Former Fox News primetime host  Bill O'Reilly  settled a sexual harassment claim in January for a record $ million."", ""One month later  Fox News' parent company   Century Fox  renewed  O'Reilly 's contract  giving  him  a four-year deal with a $ million annual salary."", "" Century Fox executive Rupert Murdoch and his sons decided to stand by  O'Reilly  despite the mounting allegations against  him ."", "" Former Fox News headliner Bill O'Reilly  settled a new sexual harassment claim for a record $ million in January  The New York Times reported on Saturday."", ""One month after  O'Reilly  settled the claim — which was at least the sixth agreement that had been reached relating to  O'Reilly 's sexual misconduct — Fox News' parent company   Century Fox  renewed the host's contract with the network and agreed to a four-year deal with a $ million annual salary."", "" The company  said in a statement that  it  was not aware of the amount of  O'Reilly 's settlement with Wiehl and saw the dispute as a personal issue between the two."", ""According to the Times   Century Fox executives Rupert Murdoch and his sons  James and Lachlan  decided to back up  O'Reilly  in January despite the mounting allegations against  him .

Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith (D) accepts  her appointment to Al Franken's newly-vacant Senate seat .  Franken  announced  he  would resign following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct. (Reuters)
Minnesota’s governor announced his intention to appoint Lt. Gov. Tina F. Smith  his former chief of staff  to fill the seat expected to be vacated by  Sen. Al Franken  — and she plans to run for election in November to finish out the term.

Franken  who has faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment  announced last week that  he  would resign  his  office “in the coming weeks ” but has not set a date. Smith said she expected to take office in “early January.”
Schumer declined to answer questions about  Franken ’s departure date or Smith on Wednesday morning  saying  he  would leave it to Dayton to make the announcement. Dayton said he had not received any written notice of  Franken ’s resignation. “ Sen. Franken  is a man of  his  word ” Dayton said. “I fully expect that  he  will follow through and resign.”
 Franken  has apologized for  his  behavior  while contesting the particulars of some women’s claims against  him . “Some of the allegations against  me  are simply not true. Others I remember very differently ”  Franken  said  when  he  announced  his  resignation  under intense pressure from  his  Democratic colleagues.
Republicans are likely to mount a serious challenge for  Franken ’s Senate seat  which was previously held by Republican Norm Coleman. One possible candidate  floated by Senate Republicans  is former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty  who unsuccessfully sought the  GOP nomination for president and now serves as president of the Financial Services Roundtable.","[""Minnesota Lt.

3483,dev,"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  on Monday blasted net neutrality activists who protested outside his home with signs directed at his children  saying the demonstration “crosses a line.”
The protests followed  Pai  saying last week that  he  would follow through on  his  pledge to repeal Obama-era Internet regulations.
The move set up a showdown with consumer groups  but the backlash recently reached  Pai 's own home -- with activists putting up cardboard signs that ask if this is the world  he  wants  his  children to ""inherit."" One sign says  ""They will come to know the truth. Dad murdered democracy in cold blood.""
“It certainly crosses a line with me ”  Pai  told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Monday. “Families … should remain out of it and stop harassing us at our homes. ... It was a little nerve-racking  especially for my wife who’s not involved in this space.”
But  Pai  argues the rules discourage the ISPs from making investments in their network that would provide even better and faster online access.
 He  also said Monday that  he  thinks the five-member Federal Communications Commission will vote - in favor of repealing the regulations. The vote is scheduled for Dec. .
“The solution is not more regulations ”  he  said. “The problem was this was slapping on more regulations.”
 Pai  has reportedly distributed  his  alternative plan to other commissioners.
Fellow Commissioner Mignon L.

3484,dev,"But the details surrounding  Corey Walgren’s  suicide in early  were so startling and so disturbing   his  parents felt compelled to do more.  Corey —  who had never been in trouble or shown any suicidal tendencies — killed  himself  after being questioned about a disciplinary matter by authorities at school  and  his  parents believe the tragedy was entirely preventable.
 They  decided if  they  wanted to truly honor  Corey ’s life   they  needed to do something that would educate students about  their  rights  warn parents about potential risks and remind educators about their responsibilities.
To achieve that goal   they  recently launched  Corey ’s Goal  a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness of the constitutional rights of minors in school settings and providing education on how disciplinary practices in schools can better support the emotional well-being of students.  They  plan speaking engagements and a website filled with information on the topic to help spread  their  message.
“We need to start telling people that this could happen in their schools ” Maureen Walgren said. “We need to get this information in front of  them  and hopefully influence change.”
 Corey  a junior at Naperville North High School   was summoned to administrative offices Jan.     to meet with Dean Stephen Madden and Naperville police Officer Brett Heun  who is assigned to the campus. The two questioned  Corey  about an allegation that  he  had a video of a consensual sexual encounter with a female classmate on  his  phone and that  he  had played the recording for friends.
Heun and Madden accused  Corey  of possessing child pornography and threatened  him  with placement on the state's sex offender registry  according to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by the Walgren family.
Heun and Madden spoke with  Corey  for  minutes  according to police reports  before calling  his  parents. Once they reached Maureen Walgren  Heun talked to her on a speakerphone with  Corey  in the room.  He  told her that her son was being investigated for ""child pornography"" and could end up being placed on the sex offender registry  Maureen Walgren has said.
 The officer  then told Maureen Walgren  he  intended to download items from  Corey 's phone and needed her consent  according to the reports. Walgren  a nurse  said she would leave work immediately and be at the school within  minutes.
After the phone call ended   the officer  and the dean walked  Corey  to an office waiting area and told  him  to sit down. The two then went to speak with the school’s principal  leaving  Corey  to wait for  his  mother.
Left by  himself    Corey  walked out of the school a few minutes later and headed toward a downtown Naperville parking garage.  He  climbed to the fifth floor and then ended  his  life by plummeting  feet to the ground.
 His  mother  who had arrived at the school to find  Corey  missing  was in  her  car just a few blocks away searching for  Corey  when  he  fell.

Despite the allegations of child pornography  police never intended to pursue charges  records show. Rather  police reports indicated authorities wanted to handle the matter in a way that ensured  Corey  understood the seriousness of  his  actions and how it affected  his  classmate.
The Naperville Police Department and Naperville Unit District  have described  Corey ’s death as a tragedy  but both say that proper procedures were followed that day.
“We continue to be incredibly saddened by  Corey 's death  and our hearts go out to  his  family  friends and all members of the Naperville community ” District  said in a statement. “Nothing is more important to us than the health  safety and security of those students entrusted to our care and we are actively engaging with the community to foster further discussions on how best to achieve this shared priority.”

 Curry  has worked in journalism for  years  and  she  spent  of those years working for NBC's Today show.

 Pat Shurmur  makes it clear how much  his  family means to  him  as  he  meets the media for the first time as Giants head coach. (Howard Simmons/New York Daily News)
Friday morning  in fact  Shurmur teared up in his introductory press conference in East Rutherford as he looked at his wife  Jennifer  of -and-a-half years and called her “the strength of our family.” The couple  who met at Michigan State  have four children: Allyson and Erica  college graduates who live in Philadelphia; Kyle  Vanderbilt’s rising-senior starting quarterback; and Claire  a high school freshman in Minnesota  where  Pat  last worked.
But while  Pat  is the high-profile NFL head coach and the hard-nosed former Spartans center who laid waste to USC defensive linemen in the  Rose Bowl  he is also the humble and human husband honorable enough to publicly recognize the woman who has been his rock the whole way:
“I didn’t know what G.O.A.T. meant until about a year ago  but that’s what Jennifer’s kids refer to her as: The G.O.A.T ” Gordon  still a family friend  said of the acronym for Greatest Of All Time more often used in NFL circles in reference to Tom Brady. “The Shurmurs are a great family. That’s what always comes through to people  and quite honestly  that’s probably what enables  Pat  to do what  he  does.”
Wishart says  Shurmur  came from a family with an admirable “work ethic” before  he  and Jennifer started their own.

 Shurmur ’s late father  Joe  a star offensive guard and linebacker at Albion College (Mich.) in the late  and early   was an orthopedic surgeon in Dearborn  Mich.  and later served as the team doctor for  Pat ’s high school squad.
 Pat ’s uncle  the late Fritz Shurmur  actually coached his brother Joe at Albion before going on to a long accomplished NFL coaching career  including a Super Bowl XXXI victory as Mike Holmgren’s defensive coordinator in Green Bay.
But more simply  Joe and Barbara Shurmur raised their four children “to work hard and do things the right way ” Wishart says.  Pat Shurmur  on Friday lauded how  his  parents “taught us to compete; they taught us how to have compassion; and they taught us how not to let anybody tell you that you can’t do something.”
And when Wishart visited  Shurmur  in Cleveland for one of his Browns OTA practices during his two-year stint as head coach from -  he saw all of Joe and Barbara’s values and lessons on display on the field.
“He talked to every player  knew every player  had something positive to say about all of them  and he had -some guys on the roster ” Wishart recalled. “When he was a player  there was no better teammate. If a guy made a mistake   Pat  was the first to put arm around him and say hey it’s over with  forget about it. And that was it: if you have good relationships with people and players  you’ve got a team.

3490,dev,"The  Harvey Weinstein  story continues to reverberate  as new accusations  denunciations  or other consequences of  his  decades of sexual harassment seem to come to light every day.  Weinstein  has dutifully been abandoned by company  industry  friends  politicians  and family.
Of all of the articles and accounts of this scandal  the most telling so far appeared in the Weekly Standard on October . Lee Smith  instead of merely repeating fresh condemnations  focused on how  Weinstein  had gotten the industry to protect  him  for so long.  Weinstein 's power in both the movie and publishing industries insured that  he  could purchase an army of enablers. But simply stating that fact does not go far enough. One must imagine the relevant scenarios and take them to their logical conclusions  as does Smith:
They  wouldn't dream of crossing a guy who could turn them into culture heroes with a phone call. Hey  I just optioned your novel and I already know who's going to make the movie. And oh yeah  please confirm that you don't  like I think I may have heard  have a reporter looking into a story about me.
Imagine the implications of that scenario.  Weinstein 's sexual assaults became so frequent that  his  publishing and moviemaking decisions were geared toward covering up those assaults. Those whose employees might be investigating  Weinstein  became prime candidates to have their articles turn into books and movies. Instant stardom and riches awaited those who would keep quiet.
Over the past thirty years  few individuals have exercised more influence over the national culture than  Harvey Weinstein .  His  movies have been well known. At one time  ""Miramax bought the rights to every big story published in magazines throughout  city.""  His  financial contributions bought access and more to the White House.  He  made careers from Hollywood to New York to Washington. I need not list  his  beneficiaries  but they are well known (some of whom now issue obligatory press releases denouncing  Weinstein 's decades of mayhem).
Not only did this influence provide cover for  Weinstein  as  he  victimized Hollywood's women  but it created a whole new class of victims who have been ignored over the past week (and apparently the previous few decades). I refer to Hollywood's consumers.  We  complain about  our  choices in movies (and television).  We  lament that there is nothing to watch (even though  we  spend exorbitant amounts to see and subscribe to these nothings). There have always been theories as to why  our  entertainment lacks quality. Now  Harvey Weinstein  has provided  us  with the most interesting theory of all. If the Weekly Standard's scenario is correct  then  Weinstein 's choices in movies and even book options were motivated not by quality (or even his own bottom line)  but by the need to cover up rape and sexual harassment.
The nation's media now devote endless bandwidth to ever more breathless denunciations by those who were all too happy to take  Weinstein 's money as long as the accusations could be squelched. But instead of serving as a conduit for the press releases of  Weinstein 's former allies and enablers  maybe our nation's ""journalists"" should try a different approach.

How hard could it be for the New York Times or the Washington Post to figure out which Miramax movies resulted from which rape coverups? Who was  Weinstein  paying off by approving or distributing which movie?
If recent press releases are any indication  it appears that  Weinstein  was not alone. The problem appears to be widespread. Who knows how many movie deals resulted from the need to cover up some sex scandal? How many scandals are our movie dollars suppressing? Should we simply applaud Hollywood for belatedly denouncing  Weinstein  and then file back into the theaters?","['The  Harvey Weinstein  story continues to reverberate  as new accusations  denunciations  or other consequences of  his  decades of sexual harassment seem to come to light every day.  Weinstein  has dutifully been abandoned by company  industry  friends  politicians  and family.', ""Of all of the articles and accounts of this scandal  the most telling so far appeared in the Weekly Standard on October . Lee Smith  instead of merely repeating fresh condemnations  focused on how  Weinstein  had gotten the industry to protect  him  for so long.  Weinstein 's power in both the movie and publishing industries insured that  he  could purchase an army of enablers. But simply stating that fact does not go far enough. One must imagine the relevant scenarios and take them to their logical conclusions  as does Smith:"", ""They  wouldn't dream of crossing a guy who could turn them into culture heroes with a phone call.

3492,dev,"In his most recent column for The New York Times  conservative writer  Ross   Douthat  tackled the mass shooting at a school in Parkland  Florida  which left  innocent people dead. While  Douthat  is typically measured and even-handed in considering what is driving men of a certain age and demographic profile to purchase deadly weapons and direct their fire at innocent people  his recommended solution to the problem — age-based bans on certain weapons — completely misses the mark.
Specifically   Douthat  recommends that “hunting rifles ” which  he  does not define  be legal to own once an individual reaches  years of age. Revolvers  under Douthat’s suggested gun control regime  would be legal at age . Semi-automatic pistols would be legal when an individual turned   and semi-automatic rifles such as the AR- could not be sold to anyone under :
Those data alone  which show that mass shootings are far more likely to be committed by those outside of  Douthat ’s proposed limits  demonstrate the folly of his gun control recommendations. But it’s not just the actual age of shooters which calls into question  Douthat ’s age-based bans; weapon usage statistics also contradict  his  calls for new strict regulations on rifles.
It's a Times list  and not school-specific  but about half of these feature semi-auto rifles. Again  just seems like there's a big gap btw what ppl use for ordinary murder (mostly handguns) and these kind of deliberate sprees. — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) February   
Forget the / provocation for now; do you think it would be a disastrous infringement on liberty if the age for semi-autos in FL had been  and not ? — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) February   
While I respect and share  Douthat ’s desire to find a solution to the problem of mass shootings  I simply disagree with not only  his  recommendations  but also their premise. The data clearly show that  his  proposals would do little to address  his  stated problem. The bigger issue  however  is one of principle. A nation cannot be made safer from criminals by restricting the God-given rights of those who respect and follow the law.

The reversal came after anchor James Brown asked  La Canfora  on “The NFL Today”: “And kneeling   he  said?”
 La Canfora  responded: “ He ’s not planning on kneeling.  He ’s going to donate all  his  jersey sales and  he ’s planning on standing for the anthem if given the opportunity  J.B.”
La Canfora tweeted later that  he  does not know what Kaepernick would do during the anthem.
Relying on unnamed sources  ESPN reported in March that Kaepernick would stand during the anthem if  he  played again. But Kaepernick has not spoken publicly about what  he  would do.
After La Canfora backed off  his  earlier report  Kaepernick tweeted: “A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on ” attributing the quote to Winston Churchill even though some scholars have said the quote was not said by the former British prime minister.
According to CBS   La Canfora  sat down with Kaepernick  his girlfriend and his trainer on Saturday night.  La Canfora  summarized their conversation but the segment did not air any comments directly made by the player.
 La Canfora  said  his  “primary takeaway” was that Kaepernick’s sole focus is on being a quarterback.

3496,dev,"Bigelow Aerospace  says  its  inflatable space hotel could be ready for lunar orbit by .
 Bigelow  is touting the future pod as a hub for ""lunar business development "" but  the company  would probably need  NASA  to get  it  funded.
 Bigelow Aerospace  a Las Vegas-based space pod company   wants to send an inflatable space hotel to orbit the moon  with accommodations for astronauts and citizen space travelers alike.
 The company  partnered with  NASA  in  to attach an inflatable  soft-shell demo pod onto the International Space Station. Now   Bigelow  has announced that a bigger inflatable pod  which it's calling the  ""lunar depot""  could be orbiting the moon in five years.
That moon station is much more ambitious than  Bigelow 's ISS add-on. It's designed to stand alone and is about a third of the size of the ISS.  The company  suggests the pod could hold roughly six people  and is billing it as a hub for ""significant lunar business development.""
Providing accommodations for future space travelers is a logical next step for  the company 's founder  Robert Bigelow  who owns the Budget Suites of America hotel chain and has been working on creating expandable space modules since .
United Launch Alliance  a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin  plans to partner with  Bigelow  to launch the habitat into space  then get it circling around the moon.
Expandable  soft-shell space habitats are easier to fit into rockets for launch than other heavier structures.  Bigelow  said in a statement that  its  pods also “provide for greater volume  safety  opportunity and economy than the aluminum alternatives.”
The company's 'Bigelow Expandable Activity Module ' or BEAM  was attached to the International Space Station in April  and then blown up to full size that May. Astronauts don't live inside it  but they use the space for experiments  collecting air and surface samples to test for microbes  as well as monitoring how effective the BEAM is at blocking radiation. NASA has said it might extend BEAM's stay at the ISS beyond its initial two year test run  and use the inflatable space as long-term storage. The space agency has said that so far  the soft materials  Bigelow  used to create BEAM are proving they can perform just as well as more rigid structures in space.
In a couple of Tweets on Tuesday   Bigelow  seemed to suggest that  he 'd need NASA funding to fully execute  his  space hotel plans. The Washington Post puts the project's price tag at $. billion.
""Re. Lunar Depot: Capital has been flowing from both companies and will continue ""  Bigelow  wrote  then added  ""NASA & this country will need to have investment also to pay for the benefits.""
NASA is currently working on a 'Deep Space Gateway' project with the Russian Space Agency  which could involve a site near the moon that would serve as a pit-stop for astronauts on long-term missions to Mars. NASA has said that site would have a ""small habitat to extend crew time."" In a statement sent to Business Insider  NASA confirmed  Bigelow  is one of six companies the agency has selected to develop full-size prototypes for the habitat.
The US has pledged to send humans to Mars by . In an announcement about the  last year   Bigelow  and United Launch Alliance said that this habitat could house researchers on their way to the Red Planet.","['Bigelow Aerospace  says  its  inflatable space hotel could be ready for lunar orbit by .', ' Bigelow  is touting the future pod as a hub for ""lunar business development "" but  the company  would probably need  NASA  to get  it  funded.', ' Bigelow Aerospace  a Las Vegas-based space pod company   wants to send an inflatable space hotel to orbit the moon  with accommodations for astronauts and citizen space travelers alike.', ' The company  partnered with  NASA  in  to attach an inflatable  soft-shell demo pod onto the International Space Station.

3497,dev,"Bitcoin Gold   a new cryptocurrency  has been created through a so-called hard fork similar to the way Bitcoin Cash was created in August.
Since Bitcoin and  Bitcoin Gold  share the same history up until the fork  anyone who owned Bitcoin around  E.T. Monday should become the owner of the same amount of Bitcoin Gold as well. But as is often the case with Bitcoin  things are not that simple.
First of  all  the Bitcoin Gold network  is not yet live.  Its  creators have merely taken a snapshot of the Bitcoin blockchain at block    but the cryptocurrency should become publicly available on Nov. .
Those who stored bitcoins at exchanges might see different results  depending on the exchange. Some exchanges  including Coinbase and BitMEX  said they will not support  Bitcoin Gold  at all (though Coinbase did say it might support it at a later date). Others  like Bittrex  said  Bitcoin  owners will receive their  Bitcoin Gold  at a : ratio. Only a few of the major exchanges said they would support  Bitcoin Gold  trading.
 Bitcoin Gold 's main reason to exist  according to the project's website  is ASIC-resistant mining. Originally   Bitcoin  could be mined (the process of mining creates new coins and powers the Bitcoin network at the same time) by anyone with a PC. However  Bitcoin's network is currently dominated by big mining companies  which employ specialized mining machines called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).  Bitcoin Gold  uses a different mining algorithm which will once again enable mining by anyone with a home PC.
However   Bitcoin Gold  has received quite a bit of criticism for being hastily put together  and for pre-mining a certain amount of coins  which essentially mean free money or the project's owners.
Despite the controversy  the price of  Bitcoin  rose to more than $  days before the fork  likely due to  Bitcoin  owners calculating that getting some free BTG can't hurt them  even if the project turns out to be a failure. Many were likely hoping for a reprise of the Bitcoin Cash fork in August. Despite initial reluctance from exchanges  Bitcoin Cash has turned out to be quite successful so far  currently trading at about $ with a market cap of more than $. billion.","['Bitcoin Gold   a new cryptocurrency  has been created through a so-called hard fork similar to the way Bitcoin Cash was created in August.', 'Since Bitcoin and  Bitcoin Gold  share the same history up until the fork  anyone who owned Bitcoin around  E.T.

3498,dev,"As the New England Patriots fidgeted during their hour-long media session Monday night ahead of Super Bowl LII  offensive coordinator  Josh McDaniels  was confronted with the inquiry  he  knew full well was coming:
It appears  after his second stint in New England – now in its sixth season – McDaniels is ready to make that move. It will be to Indianapolis  where he and the Colts are expected to consummate a deal to make him Chuck Pagano’s successor after the completion of the Super Bowl. The Colts and  McDaniels  can’t execute a deal until he’s fulfilled his duties with the Patriots.
But it’s coming  and  McDaniels  seemingly has been thinking about this moment for quite a while.  He ’s been entertaining the idea of pursuing another head-coaching gig for some time  but this year  he  finally felt the time was right. For  McDaniels   it was a matter of when  not if.
“That’s been a dream of mine forever ”  he  said. “My dad’s been a football coach all my life. I grew up around the game. I played as long as I could but I wasn’t very big or very fast or very good. So  I knew I was going to end up being a coach somewhere  somehow. I just wanted to try to get better and whatever the cards held for me  that’s great. I’d be OK with that.
“Right now  this week is special for one reason and that’s because we’re here with an opportunity to compete against the Eagles for the Super Bowl championship ”  McDaniels  said  staying on message.
But when the opportunity to be a head coach comes – cough  next week  cough –  McDaniels  clearly plans to do things differently after the apparent personality conflicts  he  left in  his  wake in Denver.
“You have people you learn from every day and you have people that you’re responsible to teach ”  he  said. “And the only way for those two things to work the right way is to have quality relationships. They go both directions. You have to be a good listener and a good teacher. You have to be willing to take advice from somebody else and you have to be willing to give it when it’s your turn.”

On Tuesday afternoon  the actor Terry Crews (""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"") said on Twitter that a film executive sexually assaulted him at an industry event last year. He started the thread by tweeting that the accusations against  Weinstein  were ""giving me PTSD.""
""This whole thing with  Harvey Weinstein  is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME. My wife n I were at a Hollywood function last year n a high level Hollywood executive came over  me and groped my privates.
""Jumping back I said What are you doing?! My wife saw everything n we looked at  him  like  he  was crazy.  He  just grinned like a jerk.
""I was going to kick  his  ass right then — but I thought twice about how the whole thing would appear. ' lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho' would be the headline the next day. Only I probably wouldn't have been able to read it because I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN JAIL. So we left.""

In the process   Claypool  asked veteran labor attorney James Franczek to reword a bill for his legal advice to disguise its original purpose  according to the report. In interviews with the IG during the investigation   Claypool  “unequivocally  emphatically and repeatedly” denied he had asked Franczek to make changes to the bill  and said “he would never have been involved in such lowly billing matters.”
But last month  in a letter to the IG's office   Claypool  apologized for intervening to reword the invoice.  Claypool 's letter acknowledged Inspector General Nicholas Schuler had documents that contradicted the CEO's initial claim.
With that  the mayor bid  Claypool  a very public adieu.

MPR said only that it received allegations of ""inappropriate behavior"" against  Keillor  last month involving one person who worked with him during his time hosting ""A Prairie Home Companion.""  Keillor  retired as host of the radio variety show last year  but continued to work for MPR on various projects.
Later Wednesday   Keillor  gave a statement to MPR News saying he had to ""respect the privacy of the two employees who have made the allegations."" A spokeswoman for MPR's corporate arm didn't immediately respond to questions from AP on whether  Keillor  was accused of bad behavior with more than one person.
 Keillor 's hand-picked successor to host the show  mandolinist Chris Thile  tweeted Wednesday he was ""in shock"" after  Keillor 's firing. Thile had been a frequent musical guest on the show and said he knew nothing about the allegation  adding: ""I trust that the proper steps are being taken.""

Sue Scott  who worked on the show as a voice actor for  years with  Keillor   told the AP she was stunned. She said she saw no evidence of inappropriate behavior from  Keillor .
Fans also were shocked. Cindy Dina  of the Minneapolis suburb of Forest Lake  said she frequently listened when  Keillor  hosted the show and admired him  saying the Minnesota native was ""iconic.""
 Keillor 's storytelling earned him comparisons with Mark Twain and Will Rogers. His  best-selling book  ""Lake Wobegon Days "" landed him on the cover of Time magazine.
""A Prairie Home Companion"" was heard by nearly  million listeners a week on nearly  public radio stations across the U.S. the year before  Keillor  left as host.

3522,dev,"Charles Manson  spent over  years in prison for the vicious murders of seven people in   including actress Sharon Tate. After  his  lengthy trial and conviction   Manson  became a constant and morbid presence in pop culture. (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)
A prelude to the conflagration was the slaughter of the seven people in two affluent Los Angeles neighborhoods. Orchestrated by  Mr. Manson  on two successive nights in August   the seemingly random killings were calculated to hasten the race war by making them appear committed by black militants. That  in turn   he  told  his  followers  would stir white sentiment against African Americans  triggering widespread violence by blacks.
Vincent Bugliosi  the hard-charging deputy district attorney who prosecuted Mr. Manson  described the  Manson  name as “a metaphor for evil.”
 Mr. Manson  was a study in stark contrasts. Small and scrawny   he  was also charismatic and held an almost hypnotic power over  his  followers  especially women. Some believed  he  was divine.
Investigators  academic researchers and journalists found  him  alternately erratic and focused  a proficient guitarist  a lover of animals  a racist and an anti-Semite with a left-leaning hatred of the “establishment” and corporate America and bitterness over  his  rejection by the music celebrity world of Hollywood.
 He  was not insane  but  he  could fake it and had an insatiable need to control others  prompting  him  to recruit naive and malleable acolytes to  his  family  according to behaviorists who studied  his  life.
“Basically  Manson was a coward ” Eric Hickey  dean of the California School of Forensic Studies at Alliant International University  told Maclean’s magazine in . “ He  was the kind of guy who had other people do  his  bidding  and I think  he  really enjoyed taking advantage of people who were gullible.”
He married twice  first to a teenage waitress  Rosalie Willis  in   divorcing in . Then in   he married a woman with a prostitution record named Leona “Candy” Stevens  according to prison records. That union also ended in divorce. A son from his first marriage  Charles Manson Jr.  who renamed himself Jay White  committed suicide in . He had a son from his second marriage  Charles Luther Manson. He had at least one other child as well.
Prosecutors depicted  Mr. Manson  as the meticulous mastermind of the murders  and while family members acknowledged  his  planning role  they said  he  did not participate in the killings. The jury nevertheless found  him  equally culpable under California’s joint-responsibility rule.
 He  was also convicted for the July  murder of Gary Hinman  and the August  murder of Donald Shea  according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.","[""Charles Manson  spent over  years in prison for the vicious murders of seven people in   including actress Sharon Tate.

3523,dev,"For  Abbie Brabham  a senior on Kingwood’s varsity girls’ basketball team   sports were a welcome distraction from Harvey’s fallout — destroyed homes  friends’ families starting over from scratch — and an opportunity to spend more time with  her  teammates  whom  she  considers  her  sisters.
Kayaks  boats  inflatable rafts  canoes and helicopters came through the neighborhood  as rescuers — some professional  some amateur — responded to neighbors who literally waved white flags.  Brabham  and her family were evacuated by one of her classmates  who drove his  truck to the house the first night of the flooding.

Inside  Brabham ’s home  any items that weren’t on higher ground were left drifting atop the water. The backyard looked like an extension of the San Jacinto River  with a sliver of a black fence poking above the still-moving water. An inflatable toy swan floated in the corner of the family’s living room  blown up by  Brabham  the night of the floods in case she needed it to evacuate.
“I was like  ‘If I am forced to float out of here  I’ll float out in style ’” said  Brabham   one of  Kingwood students who were unable to live in their homes following the hurricane. “But after the storm  the swan was a sign of hope that we had our stuff and we could eventually get back.”

3525,dev,"Last month  the Department of Homeland Security instructed federal civilian agencies to identify Kaspersky Lab software on their networks and remove it on the grounds that “the risk that the Russian government  whether acting on its own or in collaboration with  Kaspersky   could capitalize on access provided by  Kaspersky  products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.” The directive followed a decision by the General Services Administration to remove  Kaspersky  from its list of approved vendors. And lawmakers on Capitol Hill are considering a governmentwide ban.
After the U.S. banned federal agencies from using Kaspersky Lab software in September  citing concerns over its ties with Russian intelligence services   Kaspersky  spokesman Anthon Shingarov called the move a “part of a geopolitical game.” (Associated Press)
 Kaspersky  said in a statement that “as a private company  Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government  including Russia  and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight.”  The company  said  it  “does not possess any knowledge” of Israel’s hack.
 The firm’s founder  Eugene Kaspersky   said in a blog post last week that  his  anti-virus software is supposed to find malware from all quarters.
“We absolutely and aggressively detect and clean malware infections no matter the source ”  he  wrote  suggesting that the NSA hacking tools could have been picked up as malware by the anti-virus program.
Concerns about  Kaspersky  have also emerged in the cybersecurity industry  where some officials say that the firm’s software has been used not just to protect its customers’ computers but also as a platform for espionage.

 Kaspersky  is also the only major anti-virus firm whose data is routed through Russian Internet service providers subject to Russian surveillance. That surveillance system is known as the SORM  or the System of Operative-Investigative Measures.
 The company  said that customer data flowing through  Kaspersky ’s Russian servers is encrypted and that the firm does not decrypt it for the government.
It is not publicly known how the Russians obtained the NSA hacking tools in . Some information security analysts have speculated that the Russians exploited a flaw in  Kaspersky  software to filch the material.
But other experts say the Russians would not need to hack  Kaspersky ’s systems. They say that the material could be picked up through the country’s surveillance regime.
 The firm  is likely to be beholden to the Kremlin  said Steven Hall  who ran the CIA’s Russia operations for  years. He said that  Kaspersky ’s line of work is of particular interest to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and that because of the way things work in Russia   Eugene Kaspersky  “knows  he ’s at the mercy of Putin.”
“The case against Kaspersky Lab is overwhelming ” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.)  a vocal critic of  Kaspersky  who has pushed to remove the company’s software from federal networks. “The strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are very alarming.”
“That’s the crux of the matter ” said one industry official who received the briefing. “Whether  Kaspersky  is working directly for the Russian government or not doesn’t matter; their Internet service providers are subject to monitoring. So virtually anything shared with  Kaspersky  could become the property of the Russian government.”

3528,dev,"Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner  went to Austin Monday to convince lawmakers that  he  has hit upon a solution to Houston’s $. billion pension problem.
 His  answer is math — really complicated but ultimately pointless math.
Last September   Turner  promised a hard cap on the city’s pension liability and a fixed -year repayment plan. Instead   he  has delivered a bill that would allow debt to continue to accrue and repayment to be put off indefinitely.
The city is as exposed to bankruptcy as ever  as  Turner ’s plan primarily deals with what checks get written when  not with the massive debt that continues to mount.
State Sen. Joan Huffman filed a bill last week containing  Turner ’s plan  with one addition opposed by both  Turner  and the Houston unions: a requirement that the city get voter approval before issuing $ billion in pension obligation bonds.
 Turner  promised an end to that with the equivalent of a fixed -year mortgage.  He  delivered  but there’s a catch: Houston can take out second mortgages  third mortgages  and so on in perpetuity  each with a new -year repayment period.
And  Turner  would like to kick off this journey to solvency by putting  his  next house payment of $ million on the credit card  so to speak.
The upside of the plan is that  Turner  has won some concessions. The police and municipal employees unions are willing to trade some of their IOUs (payable by taxpayers) for cash up front at a steep discount. The firefighters union has decided to oppose the plan  but Huffman said Monday that they “will have to be brought along kicking and screaming.”
While  Turner ’s bill achieves some concessions  it doesn’t deliver the promised features.
“We cap the city’s exposure ”  Turner  told the committee. “The bill says that the parties are obligated to come back to the table and they shall adjust their benefits to stay within the corridor ” which is a separate cap limiting the city’s pension payments to  percent of payroll.
 Turner  said Monday that if  he ’s not able to use a pension bond to cover a $ million pension contribution that’s due  then “a lot of people will not be working.”
He pointed out that the plan lacks a -like “defined contribution” plan for new hires. That’s one of the easy first steps that struggling localities elsewhere have taken  but which  Turner  rejects for ideological reasons.
A few experts have noticed that  Turner ’s plan  if tweaked  could be used to impose a defined contribution plan through the back door. That is  in setting a defined maximum the city will pay each year  the city could be defining its contribution. But the liability loss layers would have to be stripped from the plan.","['Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner  went to Austin Monday to convince lawmakers that  he  has hit upon a solution to Houston’s $. billion pension problem.', ' His  answer is math — really complicated but ultimately pointless math.', 'Last September   Turner  promised a hard cap on the city’s pension liability and a fixed -year repayment plan.

LIMA  Peru — The Latest on Pope Francis’ visit to Peru (all times local):
The American cardinal who publicly rebuked  Pope Francis  over  his  remarks about Chilean sex abuse victims is concelebrating Francis’ final Mass in Peru.
O’Malley publicly rebuked  Francis  on Saturday for accusing victims of Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest of slandering another bishop with their claims.
 Francis  is likely to face questions about the issue on  his  in-flight news conference while returning to Rome.
 Pope Francis  is telling young Peruvians that God loves them as they are and there’s no need to “Photoshop” their hearts to make them seem perfect.
At a noon prayer from Lima’s Plaza de Armas   Francis  sought to speak to young people in their own language in encouraging them in their faith.
 Francis  is known for  his  blunt speaking style. Earlier Sunday  he  told Peruvian bishops they need to speak the language of young people to help them understand the message of the Gospel  just as Roman Catholic missionaries learned the languages of indigenous peoples as they worked to convert them.
 Pope Francis  is demanding that Congo authorities do everything in their power to avoid violence amid deadly anti-government demonstrations.
 Francis  made the appeal from the Peruvian capital  where  he  led thousands of young people in prayer.
 He  said of Congo: “I ask the authorities and those responsible and all those in this beloved country that they use maximum commitment and effort to avoid all forms of violence and look for solutions in favor of the common good.”
 Pope Francis  says the sprawling Odebrecht bribery scandal that has rippled across Latin America is “just a small anecdote” in a scourge of corruption throughout the region.
 Francis  said Sunday in remarks to bishops in Peru that politics in much of Latin America is in a state of “crisis” because of graft.
The controversy over Pope Francis’ accusations of slander against victims of Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest has followed him to Peru.
In Chile   Francis  accused victims of the country’s most notorious sexual abuser  the Rev. Fernando Karadima  of slandering another bishop by saying he knew of Karadima’s abuse but did nothing.  Francis  said there was “not one shred of proof” implicating the bishop and that the accusations against him were “calumny.”

3537,dev,"Randall Jordan-Aparo  spent four days begging for medical help.  He  suffered from a severe blood disorder and was showing signs of a dangerous flare-up: rapid heart beat  fever and debilitating bodily pain.  He  needed to go to a hospital   he  said.
In a matter of hours  guards found  Jordan-Aparo  dead on the floor of  his  cell  covered in orange residue. There was a Bible nearby  and he was positioned near the crack under his door  as if he were struggling for fresh air  according to the Miami Herald.
 Jordan-Aparo’s  death in September  became the subject of multiple probes  including an inquiry by the FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. A federal grand jury returned no indictments.
But a federal lawsuit by  Jordan-Aparo’s  family is underway  and they recently won a key victory in the case.
The lawsuit was brought by Jordan-Aparo’s -year-old daughter  who was  when he died  and her mother. It describes  Jordan-Aparo  as an orphan who was adopted after  his  biological parents committed suicide together when  he  was  years old.  He  had a criminal history of nonviolent crimes that included drug possession.
 Jordan-Aparo  was sent to the Franklin Correctional Institution in northwest Florida in October .  He  had pleaded guilty to credit card fraud and was set to serve a -month sentence.  He  was a minimum security prisoner  set to be released in early .
 His  disability  Osler-Weber-Rendu disease  is a genetic disorder that causes people to develop abnormal blood vessels  which can lead to anemia  severe bleeding and pulmonary complications.
On Sept.      he  went to the prison infirmary with pain in  his  back and  his  side. Nurses recorded a body temperature of . degrees. The lawsuit says  he  had a “serious infection” caused by  his  disease.
Medical staff “ordered bedrest and Tylenol” and sent  him  back to  his  cell  according to the complaint.
Two days later   he  went back to the infirmary  the pain on  his  left side so bad that  he  couldn’t give a urine sample. It was a “medical emergency ”  he  said. Drink more water  a nurse told  him .
“The medical services provided to  Aparo  were objectively insufficient ” it adds. “This is a deliberately indifferent and reckless disregard for the treatment of  Aparo ’s medical needs and disability.”
Later that night  he reported to the infirmary two more times. His heart rate had soared above  beats per minute and he was having trouble breathing. An inmate told a correctional officer that  Jordan-Aparo  was so sick he had passed out on a toilet and pleaded to go to a hospital  according to the complaint. Prison workers again sent him to a disciplinary dorm for threatening to sue a nurse if he wasn’t taken to a hospital.
The lawsuit says he was murdered  and accuses prison workers of wrongful death. The alleged motive:  Jordan-Aparo  had been an informant against guards at another prison. Additionally   it  alleges conspiracy  violation of  his  constitutional rights  and violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. A trial is set for spring.","['Randall Jordan-Aparo  spent four days begging for medical help.

3541,dev,"WEST PALM BEACH  Fla. (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump  insisted on Sunday “I‘m not a racist” in response to reports that  he  had described immigrants from Haiti and African countries as coming from “shithole countries.”
 Trump  also said  he  was “ready  willing and able” to reach a deal to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children from being deported but that  he  did not believe Democrats wanted an agreement.  He  tweeted earlier on Sunday that the existing program would “probably” be discontinued.
The comments led to harsh recriminations from Democrats and Republicans alike  with some critics accusing  Trump  of racism  even as bipartisan talks continued in the U.S. Congress to seek a bipartisan compromise to salvage the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  or DACA.
Asked by a reporter in Florida whether he was a racist   Trump  said: “No. I‘m not a racist. I‘m the least racist person you have ever interviewed.”
 Trump  has threatened to end DACA  but he seemed to keep the door open for a deal when he told reporters before dinner on Sunday night: “We’re ready  willing and able to make a deal on DACA  but I don’t think the Democrats want to make a deal…. The Democrats are the ones that aren’t going to make a deal.”
Love  whose parents are from Haiti  had criticized  Trump  for his remarks and called on him to apologize.

One participant at the meeting on Sunday denied that  Trump  used the term and another said  he  did not recall  Trump  making such comments.
Asked on Sunday whether  his  inflammatory remarks made it harder to get a DACA deal   Trump  said: “Did you see what various senators in the room say about my comments? They weren’t bad.”
One of Trump’s top advisers  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  said on “Fox News Sunday” she did not recall if  Trump  used “that specific phrase.”

3546,dev,"As  came to a close  Vice News profiled a woman named Barbara Harris  whose organization pays drug addicts to get themselves sterilized or have an IUD implanted.
Traveling the country in her branded RV   Harris  thinks of herself as a crusader for the many unfortunate children born into a miserable life with drug addicted parents. Indeed  many of the women whom  Harris  works with have as many as seven children  despite being addicted to heroine  meth  cocaine or crack.
""Nothing positive comes to a drug addict who gives birth to eight children that are taken away from her. This is a win-win for everybody ""  Harris  says of  her  operation.
Having operated for over  years and receiving millions in donations   Harris  has now paid for the sterilization and long-term birth control of roughly   people  a majority of whom are black women.  She  began  her  operation after adopting four children who were all born from the same drug-addicted mother.
 Harris ' moral reasoning is purely Machiavellian. In  her  mind  the ends justify the means because sterilization means fewer babies will be born into an unfortunate situation  some of whom suffer severe birth defects. ""I think if there's anything that everyone can agree on ... It's that it's not okay to abuse children ""  Harris  says in justifying  her  practice.

 Keillor  also downplayed his power over  the woman  by portraying himself as uninvolved in the mundane operations of the radio show he created nearly a half-century ago and built into a powerhouse that attracted millions of listeners nationwide each Saturday evening  spun off assorted businesses and tours and inspired a movie.
""I was not really the boss around 'Prairie Home Companion '""  Keillor  said. ""I was a writer sitting in a dim office at a typewriter  back in the old days."" He also said: ""I had no control over her whatsoever. She worked at home.""
The woman said in an emailed response through her attorney that  Keillor  ""had the power to provide or take away job assignments and opportunities. He also acknowledged several times that power imbalance between us  recognizing how his conduct could be offensive when it was coming from the person for whom I work.""
She also said she wasn't interested in anything but a ""collegial"" relationship with  Keillor .
MPR spokeswoman Angie Andresen said the station stands by its handling of the claims against  Keillor . In January  the company said the woman had accused  Keillor  of dozens of sexually inappropriate incidents over several years  including requests for sexual contact and explicit sexual communications and touching.
Prior to the interview   Keillor 's attorneys allowed the AP to view hundreds of emails between  Keillor  and the woman dating from  to   on condition that they could be described but not quoted directly.
Some were work-related  including details from her research and  Keillor 's critiques. But many were personal  sharing details about their families and emotional struggles from their home email accounts  and some were overtly sexual.
The tone began changing in   as the pair began sharing more about their lives and signing off by saying they loved and missed each other. By  and   the emails became more amorous. They both shared wishes or fantasies of being intimate  sometimes in detail. In one July     email   Keillor  wrote of his desire to reach into the woman's blouse and hold her breast in his hand.  Keillor  was married at the time and still is.
""I agree that there are adolescent passages in there  but there were some by her and some by me  "" Keillor  told the AP.
 Keillor  also wrote about wanting to touch the woman  kiss her  or be naked with her on several occasions. She replied in kind. The emails also included some explicit acknowledgements by  Keillor  of their work relationship  with him apologizing for some of the emails and noting that he was the person she worked for — but that he didn't feel like her boss.
When MPR cut ties with  Keillor  in November  his public statement at the time acknowledged one incident -- placing his hand on a woman's bare back in what he portrayed as an accident. He said then it was the only incident he could remember.
MPR has removed archived  Keillor  shows from its website and no longer rebroadcasts shows he hosted.

The man who seems about to take his place  Emmerson Mnangagwa  was deeply involved in most of those crimes  yet people in  Zimbabwe   like the outside world  will be so relieved to see Mr Mugabe go that they will be tempted to forget all that.
They'll also forget the few unquestionably good things Robert Mugabe did.  Zimbabwe   for instance  has an extraordinarily high literacy rate  because of him. But that's certainly not what he'll be remembered for.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Mr Mugabe's resignation ""provides  Zimbabwe  with an opportunity to forge a new path free of the oppression that characterised his rule"".
She said that former colonial power Britain  ""as  Zimbabwe 's oldest friend""  will do all it can to support free and fair elections and the rebuilding of the Zimbabwean economy.
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC he hoped that  Zimbabwe  was on a ""new trajectory"" that would include free and fair elections. He said Mr Mugabe should be allowed to ""go and rest for his last days"".

3554,dev,"Lawyers for  former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort   shown last month  acknowleged Thursday that  Manafort  was involved with an opinion piece about  his  case in a Ukrainian newspaper. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)
 Manafort ’s defense argued in a court filing to a federal judge in Washington that  Manafort ’s work on the op-ed piece for an English-language newspaper in Kiev defending himself did not violate a court gag order because it would not likely bias potential jurors in any U.S. trial.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had ordered  Manafort  to respond by Thursday to Monday’s allegation that he had violated the gag order. Prosecutors cited the purported violation as a reason for pulling out of a proposed joint bail deal that would release  Manafort  from home detention and GPS monitoring as he awaits trial on charges of money laundering  fraud and failing to register as a foreign agent when he worked as a consultant to a Ukrainian political party.
Prosecutors argued that  Manafort  defended  his  work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine in the opinion piece  he  ghostwrote with an unidentified person they say was a longtime Russian colleague assessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service.
 Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort  was indicted on money laundering and other charges Oct. . The unsealed indictment reveals details of  Manafort ’s lavish lifestyle. (Patrick Martin Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)

 Manafort’s  defense team said the piece  posted online Thursday by the Kyiv Post  was written by Oleg Voloshyn  a Ukrainian political commentator and former Foreign Ministry spokesman  as Voloshyn also told The Washington Post earlier this week.
Earlier  prosecutor Andrew Weissmann had argued that  Manafort ’s work on the editorial “clearly was undertaken to influence the public’s opinion of  defendant Manafort  ” saying there would be no other reason for  Manafort  and the colleague to have  it  published under someone else’s name.
Manafort and Kilimnik were in close contact during the months that  Manafort  ran Trump’s campaign. They met twice in person  including an August  dinner in New York City where Kilimnik has said their conversation included discussion of the presidential campaign.
For a decade   Manafort  and Kilimnik worked with then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych  who was initially considered pro-Western but eventually became allied with Russian interests.
Voloshyn argued in the editorial that  Manafort  favored Ukraine’s integration with Europe and had opposed Russia’s interests.
Kilimnik also served as  Manafort ’s liaison to Oleg Deripaska  an aluminum magnate and ally to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin who employed Manafort as an investment consultant.
According to emails described to The Post   Manafort  directed Kilimnik to offer Deripaska “private briefings” about Trump’s campaign. A Deripaska spokeswoman has said he was never offered such briefings.

3556,dev,"Special counsel prosecutors  say  they  have uncovered new evidence of alleged criminal activity by  former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort   according to a newly unsealed court filing Friday evening.
Lawyers from special counsel Robert Mueller's office wrote that they had learned new information about  Manafort  since the judge first ruled on a bail package that would allow him to leave home confinement  and were opposing  Manafort 's bid to modify those terms of release.
""That criminal conduct includes a series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies "" prosecutors wrote  including criminal conduct related to the mortgage on one of the properties that  Manafort  said  he  would agree to forfeit if  he  failed to show up to court.
Bank fraud was not part of the indictment returned by a federal grand jury against  Manafort  and  his  longtime associate and former senior Trump campaign official Rick Gates in late October. As of Friday evening  no new charges had been filed against  Manafort or Gates  on the public docket. Prosecutors wrote in the redacted document made public on Friday that they were prepared to present the new evidence they had found at a future bail hearing for  Manafort .
Manafort and Gates were charged with conspiracy to launder money  failing to report overseas bank accounts  failing to register as agents for foreign entities  and making false statements. Both pleaded not guilty  and  Manafort  has sued the Justice Department and Mueller  challenging the validity of Mueller's appointment as special counsel.
Since the indictment  the case has been tied up in fights over  Manafort  and Gates' conditions of release. They were both placed under home confinement at their first court appearance on Oct.   and spent the following months trying to have that house arrest lifted.
US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled in mid-December that  Manafort  could go free if he met certain conditions  including agreeing to forfeit four properties if he failed to come to court  and living in Florida  abiding by an  p.m. curfew  and needing the judge's approval to travel elsewhere in the United States. But  Manafort  did not file the required paperwork to fulfill the judge's order  and on Friday filed a redacted version of a request he originally filed under seal dated Feb.  seeking to modify the judge's conditions.
 Manafort 's new request proposed putting up several different real estate properties  which  he  said were jointly valued at $. million  and living in Alexandria  Virginia  instead of Florida. Jackson's December order required Manafort's wife and daughter to serve as sureties and certify that they had $ million in cash or securities on hand in case the value of the real estate was less than $ million  but  Manafort  in  his  new proposal asked to remove the surety requirement.
 Manafort 's latest proposal prompted a response from Mueller's team  which was filed with the court on Feb.  but not made public until Friday night. Prosecutors said  Manafort 's new bail proposal was worth less than $ million  and warned that they had uncovered evidence that  Manafort  secured a mortgage for one of the properties ""through a series of false and fraudulent representations"" to the bank. They alleged that in  and   Manafort ""provided the bank with doctored profit and loss statements"" for his company  DMP International LLC  which overstated its income by ""millions of dollars.""
On the removal of the surety requirement  prosecutors wrote that  ""The fact that  Manafort  has not been able to find any responsible surety to cosign a bond for this package suggests that neither those closest to  him   nor anyone else  is willing to assume the risk of being a surety for  him .""
Manafort's lawyer Kevin Downing did not immediately return a request for comment  and a spokesman for  Manafort  declined to comment.  Jackson  has ordered  Manafort  and Gates  their defense lawyers  and the prosecutors not to make public statements that could prejudice the case.
In a separate filing late Friday in  Manafort 's civil suit challenging the special counsel appointment  his lawyers said they brought the case ""shortly after and in direct response to the Special Counsel’s threats to bring additional charges against Mr. Manafort in venues outside the District of Columbia."" The filing didn't provide details on what exactly prosecutors may have told Manafort about the possibility of other charges in other courts.","['Special counsel prosecutors  say  they  have uncovered new evidence of alleged criminal activity by  former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort   according to a newly unsealed court filing Friday evening.', ""Lawyers from special counsel Robert Mueller's office wrote that they had learned new information about  Manafort  since the judge first ruled on a bail package that would allow him to leave home confinement  and were opposing  Manafort 's bid to modify those terms of release."", '""That criminal conduct includes a series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies "" prosecutors wrote  including criminal conduct related to the mortgage on one of the properties that  Manafort  said  he  would agree to forfeit if  he  failed to show up to court.', 'Bank fraud was not part of the indictment returned by a federal grand jury against  Manafort  and  his  longtime associate and former senior Trump campaign official Rick Gates in late October.

Harvey Weinstein in . (Photo: Richard Shotwell  Invision/AP)
Of the many horrifying and shocking details in Tuesday's The New Yorker report that  movie mogul Harvey Weinstein  allegedly raped  sexually assaulted and sexually harassed more than a dozen women  one that sticks out is a quote from French actress Emma de Caunes  who said  Weinstein  exposed  himself  to her in a hotel room in .
The magazine's searing investigation into Weinstein's alleged sexual predation comes only five days after The New York Times published a meticulous account that detailed three decades of alleged sexual harassment and abuse. The Times published another report on Tuesday  in which Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie accused  Weinstein  of harassment.
It's an indictment of  Weinstein   who has since been fired from  his  own company and denounced by dozens of A-list stars and filmmakers who have worked with  him . But it's also an indictment of the Hollywood culture that allowed  Weinstein 's abuses to continue for nearly  years  seemingly unabated.

The issue isn't isolated to  Weinstein  or the film industry. This happens in every industry  in social circles  in public spaces. Keeping track of just the famous male figures at the center of these allegations is downright exhausting.
Much has been said in the past few days of the “whisper networks” by which women communicate to protect themselves  including the one that made at least part of  Weinstein 's behavior common knowledge. Some have asked why no woman has spoken on the record about  Weinstein 's behavior before now. That's the wrong question. It's not the whispers we should be focusing on  but the deafening silence of bystanders and enablers. It's the culture — both within and beyond Hollywood — dominated by toxic masculinity that ignored  Weinstein 's problematic behavior  that let rumor remain rumor  and that endangers women everywhere if it's not curtailed.

The list of men in Hollywood who have been accused of sexual misconduct  harassment or assault gets longer all the time. Woody Allen. Bill Cosby. Roman Polanski. Casey Affleck and Louis C.K. have been accused of misconduct. The broader film community also has been rocked by allegations against prominent film bloggers Devin Faraci and Harry Knowles and “Honest Trailers” creator Andy Signore.  The Los Angeles art house cinema Cinefamily  suspended operations after accusations surfaced.
 We  know  Harvey Weinstein  isn’t the only one  but how many predators are left that  we  don’t know about? Accusers risk their livelihoods and further harassment by speaking out. Some don't understand what has happened. Others are told to get used to it  to ""be cool"" or ""take a joke.""

 She  had been called upon to perform a duty that only the truest of American patriots  our Gold Star families  must do — claim the body of a fallen soldier upon his return home.
 White House Chief of Staff John Kelly  would have us forget about Johnson’s grief and reserve our empathy for Trump.
In a rare appearance before the news media on Thursday   Kelly  reminded us that the president is  after all  inexperienced in making condolence calls to Gold Star families.
 Kelly  implored Americans to understand how difficult it was for someone who has never worn the uniform  who has never been in combat  to make such a call. Some presidents send a letter instead   he  said. But Trump chose to call.
Our president is incapable of speaking from the heart  though. So  Kelly   a retired four-star general who lost his own son in Afghanistan  stood by the president’s side and fed the words to him.
The problem wasn’t what Trump said to the grieving widow   Kelly  intimated. It was the fact that a Florida congresswoman  an “empty barrel” as he referred to  her   spoke out about it.
 Kelly  revealed during the news conference  albeit unintentionally  that Trump had lied. What Wilson said was true. Trump had repeated in the telephone call exactly what  Kelly  had told him to say.
The fact that he works for a man who is both a coward and a liar is not what concerns  Kelly   though.  He  is most troubled that details of the telephone conversation got out.
 Kelly  said  he  is stunned that the things that were sacred in our country when  he  was growing up are no longer sacred. Most Americans are stunned  too.
“Women were sacred  looked upon with great honor ”  Kelly  said. “But that’s obviously not the case anymore.”
 He  could have added that  his  boss  the president of the United States  has contributed immensely to the growing irreverence for women.
Religion seems to be gone as well   Kelly  said. He should have pointed out that no president ever has been so determined to undermine religious freedom in America as Trump.
As for the sanctity of Gold Star families  “that left in the convention over the summer ”  Kelly  said.
Analysis:  Kelly  might not be like Trump  but  he  seems like many Trump voters »
 Kelly  did not mention Trump’s brutal verbal attack on the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention.

“ He  never said anything to  me  or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen ” Danley    said in a written statement read to reporters by her attorney in Los Angeles  where the FBI was questioning her.

In her statement after being questioned in Los Angeles  Paddock’s girlfriend  Danley  insisted she knew Paddock as “a kind  caring  quiet man.”
“It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.” Her lawyer  Matt Lombard  said  Danley  was “fully cooperating” with the investigation.
 Danley   an Australian citizen of Filipino heritage  said  she  flew back to the United States voluntarily “because I know that the FBI and Las Vegas Police Department wanted to talk to me  and I wanted to talk to them.”
Danley  who was twice married before  her  relationship with Paddock  became a focus of the investigation for having shared his retirement community condo in Mesquite  Nevada  northeast of Las Vegas  before leaving the United States for the Philippines in mid-September.

3568,dev,"It was to be expected that  Wayne LaPierre   the Executive Vice President of the National Rifle Association (NRA)  would talk about guns and the importance of the Second Amendment during  his  speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday. But  LaPierre  also fiercely criticized institutions like the FBI and the mainstream media — and did so using rhetoric that  at times  sounded a lot like President Donald Trump.
“Every day young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide open soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder ”  LaPierre  said during  his  CPAC speech Thursday. “It should not be easier for a madman to shoot up a school than a bank or a jewelry store or some Hollywood gala. Schools must be the most hardened target in this country and evil must be confronted immediately with all necessary force to protect our kids.”
While it has long been the NRA’s position that there should be more guns in schools to guard against mass shootings — “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun” is a talking point  LaPierre  has used for years —  LaPierre  followed Trump’s lead during  his  CPAC speech  fiercely criticizing the FBI for the Florida shooting. The FBI has acknowledged it failed to properly investigate a tip about alleged shooter Nikolas Cruz.
Trump’s and  LaPierre ’s attacks on Thursday also extended to the mainstream news media  long a favorite foil of conservatives – and perhaps Trump more so than anyone. Just as the President has dismissed stories and even entire news outlets whose coverage is unfavorable to him as “fake news ”  LaPierre  lamented that coverage of the Second Amendment and gun control issues is unfairly skewed  saying journalists “hate the NRA” and are “eager to smear” the organization. Speaking at the NRA’s annual meeting last year   LaPierre  said the media was constructing a “calculated campaign to destroy honest truth… to dictate how we should think  how we should feel  or how we should act.”
And despite whatever daylight may open in the days ahead between Trump   LaPierre  and the NRA — on strengthening background checks  raising age requirements for gun purchases  and how exactly to change the rules around “bump stocks” — they agree on something else: that the NRA cares.
“What many people don’t understand  or don’t want to understand  is that Wayne  Chris  and the folks who work so hard at the NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots ” Trump said Thursday morning on Twitter. “They love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

Al Franken (D-Minn.) officially lost the support of many of  his  colleagues Wednesday  when more than  Democratic senators and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee called on  him  to step down amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations  including groping and kissing women without their consent.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)  who has been a leader on raising awareness about the epidemic of sexual misconduct  was the first to call on  Franken  to go.
“I have been shocked and disappointed to learn over the last few weeks that a colleague I am fond of personally has engaged in behavior towards women that is unacceptable ” she said in a Facebook post. “I consider  Senator Franken  to be a friend and have enjoyed working with  him  in the Senate in our shared fight to help American families. But this moment of reckoning about our friends and colleagues who have been accused of sexual misconduct is necessary  and it is painful. We must not lose sight that this watershed moment is bigger than any one industry  any one party  or any one person.”
Today  I am calling on my colleague  Al Franken  to step aside. I’ve struggled with this decision because  he ’s been a good Senator and I consider  him  a friend. But that cannot excuse  his  behavior and  his  mistreatment of women. (thread) — Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) December   
 Al Franken  should resign. — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) December   
It is clear that  Al Franken  has engaged in a pattern of egregious and unacceptable behavior toward women.  He  should resign. — Sen. Maggie Hassan (@SenatorHassan) December   
Sexual harassment and misconduct should not be allowed by anyone and should not occur anywhere. I believe the best thing for  Senator Franken  to do is step down. — Kamala Harris (@SenKamalaHarris) December   
“I’m shocked and appalled by  Sen. Franken’s  behavior. It’s clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful  persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time ” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement. “It’s time for him to step aside.”
I believe it is best for  Senator Franken  to resign. — Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) December   
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also called on  Franken  to resign. An aide said she had spoken to him privately and told him it was the right thing to do.
Fellow Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) notably did not join her colleagues in calling for  Franken ’s resignation.
“Senator Klobuchar personally spoke with  Senator Franken  this morning. As has been reported   he  will be making an announcement tomorrow morning ” her state director  Ben Hill  said in a statement.
Eight women have now come forward with allegations that  Franken  sexually harassed them over the years.
A tipping point for the Democratic senators was a story published Wednesday by Politico  in which a woman said  Franken  tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of a radio show in .  Franken  was not yet a senator  and  he  reportedly told the woman that it was  his  “right as an entertainer” to kiss her.
“We posed for the shot. He immediately put his hand on my waist  grabbing a handful of flesh. I froze. Then he squeezed. At least twice ” DuPuy wrote. “Al Franken’s familiarity was inappropriate and unwanted. It was also quick; he knew exactly what he was doing.”
Gillibrand stopped short of calling for Democratic leaders to pressure  Franken  to resign  but said that an ongoing Senate ethics investigation is “not equipped” to adequately address the situation.","['WASHINGTON ― Sen.

3573,dev,"GAZA (Reuters) -  Mohammad Dahlan  who played a key backroom role in a major new effort for Palestinian unity   has said a two-state peace agreement with Israel was impossible and healing wounds from a civil war that split Palestine was now a priority.
“It was an honor for us ... that we succeeded to have those understandings between Hamas and Egypt ”  Dahlan  said by telephone from Abu Dhabi.  The former Gaza security chief  said  he  had kept silent during mediation efforts but decided to speak out now that they have borne fruit.
 Dahlan  said Egypt  which has accused Hamas of aiding an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula across the border from Gaza  held meetings with senior officials of the group  which denies aiding the militants.

In the interview   Dahlan  called on Hamas “to show more patience because all the good things are on the way” thanks to Egyptian mediation.
 He  dismissed any notion that Egypt  with the UAE and Saudi Arabia  was pursuing Palestinian reconciliation as part of any wider U.S.-initiated push for a regional peace deal with Israel.
“The ball is in his court and we are ready whenever he is ” said  Dahlan   in exile since  after quarrelling with Abbas.
 Dahlan  said  his  strong ties with the UAE helped  him  to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for Palestinians in Gaza  the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the past  years.
A recent poll by the West Bank-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey showed that those who still support Fatah in Gaza are shifting loyalty to  Dahlan .  His  popularity among Gazans has risen over the past nine months from nine to  percent.
 Dahlan  said  he  was not “obsessed” by opinion polls and a decision on whether  he  would run for a president would await until an election date is set.","['GAZA (Reuters) -  Mohammad Dahlan  who played a key backroom role in a major new effort for Palestinian unity   has said a two-state peace agreement with Israel was impossible and healing wounds from a civil war that split Palestine was now a priority.', '“It was an honor for us ... that we succeeded to have those understandings between Hamas and Egypt ”  Dahlan  said by telephone from Abu Dhabi.

3577,dev,"That flimsiness extends to the rest of the document  the release of which FBI officials and Democrats have been furiously lobbying against for days  in part because it amounts to ammunition  Trump  and  his  allies can use to try to shut down the Russia investigation. Even on first reading  the most striking part of the memo is what it leaves out.
Which is to say the memo fails to account for the fact that Page was no longer on Team Trump when the feds went after him in .
Likewise  the memo does not explicitly acknowledge a previous FISA application that’s been reported against Page as far back as   possibly set up because he was being actively recruited by Russian spies who subsequently were expelled or imprisoned. What the memo suggests is simply that the feds submitted reauthorization applications around January     in April   and July of . With each reauthorization  as the memo alludes  the Justice Department would have had to show that it continued to obtain foreign intelligence from the surveillance.

Grealis and her husband  Gary  have been together since they were teenagers. But neither Gary nor their two adult children was able to donate to Joan. ""They were all tested  and for various medical reasons  they couldn't donate ""  Grealis  said.

“I’m shocked and appalled by  Senator Franken’s  behavior ” wrote Sen. Patty Murray on Twitter. “It’s clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful  persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time.”
Others facing re-election in   such as Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill  did not waste time coming out against  Franken .
 “Al Franken  should resign ” she wrote shortly.
The demands for  Franken ’s resignation came after TIME magazine named the women who spoke out against harassment as their “Person of the Year.”
Even Senator Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono — who previously defended  Franken  — turned on him and demanded that he step aside.
“Today  I am calling on my colleague  Al Franken  to step aside. I’ve struggled with this decision because  he ’s been a good Senator and I consider  him  a friend ” she wrote. “But that cannot excuse  his  behavior and  his  mistreatment of women.”

3590,dev,"There will be differences between tax reform bills proposed by Republicans in the House and Senate  but at the end of the day   Sen. Marco Rubio  said  he  does not see a clash occurring between the two chambers over the bill.
 Rubio  said one of the things  he  knows will be different in the two bills is the matter of the state and local taxes exemption.
""I live  you know  in Florida and I do my taxes ""  Rubio  said. ""I get to write off my property tax  a portion of the sales tax  if you're itemizing.""
Many people are angry over possibly losing that exemption  but  Rubio  said what really matters is how much people will be paying overall  not how they get to that figure.
""While that may be going away  there are other things that are going up ""  Rubio  said. ""The overwhelming majority of Americans who need a tax cut are going to get one  so in the end  it doesn't really matter . . . what matters most of all is how much are you paying  because i think that's what people care about at the end of the day  how much they are paying.""
The bill being unveiled Thursday  meanwhile  is just a starting point   Rubio  said  and  he  anticipates there will be things in it  he 'd like to change.
""If the child tax credit is not high enough or if it's not refundable  I'll want to change that  because I think we have to do that for working families — people out there that are raising two  three  four children ""  Rubio  said. ""Both parents work really hard. We can't raise their taxes. They need a tax cut. It's expensive to raise kids.""
 Rubio   in an op-ed piece for The New York Times over the weekend  called for doubling the per-child tax credit to $  and making it refundable against payroll tax liability.  He  also said that the House tax bill falls short in that regard  and does not know if the Senate will add more.
""I don't know if they'll get to that number "" Rubio said  'But I think it will be better. I expect it'll be better than the House position. And we'll keep working on it.

Richmond  Va. — According to a new poll by Public Policy Polling  Governor-Elect Ralph Northam remains popular with voters in Republican-held legislative swing districts — and voters there strongly back bipartisan policy solutions on a range of issues  from health care to gun violence prevention to economic development.
“ Ralph Northam  ran on a common-sense agenda to move Virginia forward last November — and  he  won in a landslide victory ” said DPVA Chairwoman Susan Swecker. “Now  voters want leaders in both parties to come together and work with  Governor-Elect Northam  to pass common sense solutions that help Virginia families. As the new year begins  lawmakers in the General Assembly have a unique opportunity to put aside their partisan differences and deliver for the people of Virginia.”
“In these polarized times it’s unusual to see majority support for a Governor and his party’s policy proposals in districts represented by the opposite party ” said Director of Public Policy Polling Tom Jensen. “A majority of voters in these districts represented by Republican legislators view  Ralph Northam  favorably — and they show strong support for Democratic policy solutions.”
In November   Northam  won twelve legislative districts currently held by Republican delegates and state senators  along with HD  and   which are still being contested. The survey found that  Northam   and the Democratic agenda  remain popular with voters in these Republican-leaning districts.  percent of voters in these Republican-held districts — which are cumulatively more Republican than Virginia as a whole — view  Northam  favorably  while only  percent with an unfavorable opinion of him.","['New Poll: In Swing Districts  Voters Strongly Support Governor-Elect Ralph Northam and the Democratic Agenda', 'Richmond  Va. — According to a new poll by Public Policy Polling  Governor-Elect Ralph Northam remains popular with voters in Republican-held legislative swing districts — and voters there strongly back bipartisan policy solutions on a range of issues  from health care to gun violence prevention to economic development.', '“ Ralph Northam  ran on a common-sense agenda to move Virginia forward last November — and  he  won in a landslide victory ” said DPVA Chairwoman Susan Swecker. “Now  voters want leaders in both parties to come together and work with  Governor-Elect Northam  to pass common sense solutions that help Virginia families.

3595,dev,"In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein revelations  one of the first things I thought was: ""Who's next?""  My wife Anna Scott  a public radio reporter for KCRW in Los Angeles  had an answer: James Toback .
 She  is one of what appears to be a very long list of women who have been accosted by the New York-based writer and director behind films like Black and White  Two Girls and a Guy and The Pick Up Artist. My wife's own gruesome story dates back to about  years ago  when she was a senior in high school. Toback vaguely offered her a film role and then proceeded to talk to her about masturbation and pubic hair. Fortunately  she managed to extricate herself as the conversation moved to the prospect of heading to a hotel room somewhere  but she was still left feeling humiliated.
As a reporter for LA Weekly who's covered sexual misconduct cases before  I began reaching out to a number of women who had tweeted about their own  Toback  experiences. I spoke with a total of nine of them  all of whom revealed similar stories of unwanted sexual advances from  Toback   a mere fraction of the  who initially talked to reporter Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times. Since the story first published  hundreds of others  including Selma Blair  Rachel McAdams and Julianne Moore  have reportedly come forward. Most of the stories I heard followed a similar plot.
Ambika Leigh says she met Toback in   when she was a -year-old aspiring actress and waitress at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel  and that he told her he was a director looking for an actress to collaborate with on his next film. According to Leigh  they would meet a number of times over the next two months  for lunch or dinner  and just talk. After dinner one night  she says   Toback  invited her to a house where he was staying. She says  Toback  told her  he  wanted to do some ""acting exercises"" with her  in order to build trust and establish a bond that  he  said was important to  his  filmmaking process. She was reluctant at first  but finally agreed.
"" He  sat me on a chair and kneeled down in front of me "" she recalls. ""Before I knew what was happening   he  was humping my shin. Humping me like a dog. It was so shocking."" She says she found the act more pathetic than threatening. ""I started laughing at  him  "" she says. ""And then  quickly   he  came in  his  pants. I could feel the warmth on my leg.  He  totally ejaculated.""
She says  Toback  began analyzing her body  commenting on how  he  would photograph her  what parts of her  he  would allow the camera to rest upon. Next  she says   he  asked her to sit on a chair and began telling her about other actresses  he 'd slept with  how it was part of  his  process. After what seemed like hours of just talking  she says  he  walked over – still fully dressed – crouched down  and started rubbing  his  crotch against her leg. ""I looked at  him  "" says Kamin  who then asked  him   ""'Are you trying to get off?' And  he  looked at me and said  'Absolutely.' I just said  'No  I'm out.' I grabbed my clothes and left.""
I reached out to  Toback  through  his  agent  Jeff Berg  who has since parted ways with the director.  Toback  called me back on Tuesday  October   four days before the Times story was published.  He  asked me if I was recording the call. I wasn't.  He  told me  he  was  and that  he  wouldn't talk to  me  if I didn't – I wouldn't believe how many times  he 'd been misquoted   he  said. I told  him  I'd figure something out  and  he  said  he 'd call back in a few hours. And so  he  did.
 James Toback : Lemme be really clear about this. I don't want to get a pat on the back  but I've struggled seriously to make movies with very little money  that I write  that I direct  that mean my life to  me . The idea that I would offer a part to anyone for any other reason than that he or she was gonna be the best of anyone I could find is so disgusting to  me . And anyone who says it is a lying cocksucker or cunt or both. Can I be any clearer than that?
Toback: Anyone who says that  I just want to spit in his or her fucking face. I'm sitting here with Sienna Miller. By the way  no one who's ever worked with  me  would ever say anything like that. No one. But I've just finished a movie with Sienna  which you should see  and help to get out there  called The Private Life of a Modern Woman. But here  she's sitting right here  so just say hello to her.

 Toback : No  seriously  I find it offensive and insulting and disgusting  that people… Because it's the opposite of the way I work. I don't give my best friends parts unless they deserve them. Ever.
 Toback : Give me one name.
 Toback : OK  that is a total lie. I never heard of the person before. And then who was the other one? First of all  that description wouldn't fit anyone  but I never heard that name before in my life. And believe me  I would remember it  because it's a very unusual name.
 Toback : Anything like that is nauseating and disgusting. And I would never say anything like 'I'll get you a film role.' It's too stupid to dignify. It's pathetic lies. It's just too fucking embarrassing and idiotic. And if I were you  I wouldn't go repeating it  unless you really knew it were true  because it isn't. So that's all I have to say. This is not worth wasting another second on.
 Toback : OK.
Shortly after I hung up   Toback  called back. This time  I didn't record the call. He told me he thought my questions were ""really rude "" and that I should talk to someone he's actually worked with. ""You can speak to a multitude of people I've worked with "" he said  ""you will never hear anything but a good word.

3597,dev,"It is very easy to look at  Harvey Weinstein  and make a moral judgement.  The man  was an immensely powerful studio executive with the power to make or break careers.  He  forced  himself  on dozens  if not literally hundreds of women.  He  is  quite frankly  unattractive. In short   he  fits the image of a serial rapist. We can look at  his  behavior and match it to what we collectively understand about rape. There is no semblance of consent anywhere in there. Men can examine their own behavior and say “I have never whipped it out and masturbated into a potted plant ” and do so with confidence. They are not Harvey Weinstein.
But  Aziz Ansari  is more complicated  because it is less cut and dry. There are not hundreds of women coming forward. There is no weird sexual behavior  only relatively common practices.  The woman  doesn’t even have a firm identity that we can use to make comparative judgments about our proximity to  her . (This is not to say I don’t believe the account  just that anonymity often raises public suspicion a la Rolling Stone’s “A Rape on Campus”.) Men read Grace’s story and begin to panic. They’ve done things like that before - had sex without communicating  had a hook-up end with someone in tears. Does this mean they too will lose their careers  their standing in the public? If it can happen to Aziz Ansari  a self-proclaimed feminist comedian  could it really happen to anyone?
Harvey Weinstein is an anomaly  or at least a relative rarity. Aziz Ansari is not. When Weiss adds the throwaway line  “I’m apparently the victim of sexual assault” at the beginning of the piece  it has a kind of weight to it that few readers likely pick up on. It signifies that  yes  the epidemic of sexual violence really is as widespread and pervasive as we’ve been saying  because sexual violence doesn’t just entail brutal  violent acts of rape. It means that  no  it’s not just as easy as women being able to boldly proclaim their sexual agency in the same way that men do without being labeled a slut or a whore. It says that  yes  men are complicit in this system in a variety of ways and at different places within the hierarchy of abuse.
The sad fact is that Grace  whoever she may be  did not choose to have what to most men seems an unpleasant sexual encounter become so deeply upsetting. Perhaps another woman would have been disturbed but ultimately unaffected in the long term. But this is not how trauma operates.  We  do not get to choose when and how it affects  us   or under what circumstances it can seep into  us . When  we  freeze up  choke on  our  words  are unable to fully sit in  our  bodies it is not because  we  consciously choose to do so  it is because  we  revert to some primal instinct of self-protection.","['It is very easy to look at  Harvey Weinstein  and make a moral judgement.

 Elizabeth  remembers  “Fear was not being able to provide for them and not being able to meet their needs.”
The income  she  received from child support and  her  full-time job wasn’t enough to pay for the basics. So  Elizabeth  began using credit cards to buy groceries  clothes and to pay  her  bills. Before long   she  was $  in debt.
 Elizabeth  recalls  “I was constantly worried about how I was going to pay bills  how I was going to pay rent sometimes. How I was going to pay the electric bill.”
To make matter’s worse   Elizabeth ’s employer relocated  her . In doing so   her  living expenses doubled.
 Elizabeth  shares  “A lot of my prayers were just  ‘Just help me make it through to the next whenever.’”
Over the next four years   Elizabeth  lived paycheck to paycheck. Then  at the suggestion of a friend   she  started attending a new church. It was there  she  learned the importance of tithing.
 Elizabeth  says  “That was the first time I ever heard somebody say to  me  that like God owns % and He allows you to keep %. I knew  for a fact I was not living and doing what God's best was.”
That’s when  she  said  she  heard God speak to  her .
 Elizabeth  recalls  “It wasn't audible  but I just remember hearing God say  ‘You have to trust me. You just have to trust me.’”
The following Sunday   Elizabeth  began tithing at church.
 Elizabeth  shares  “I would like to say that suddenly I had this huge windfall and I made like a gazillion extra dollars. That did not happen. I had just enough. I had what I needed.”
During this time   she  also learned about the importance of having a budget and how to get out of debt.
 Elizabeth  says  “You pay God  you pay yourself  and then you pay all the other expenses. And so I 've actually started saving. Oh and the other really great thing about saving for Christmas and birthdays  is I don't put it on a credit card  right? And so I pay cash for everything  that's so great  I love it.”
 Elizabeth  started a new retail job with a % salary increase. And then over the next few months   she  received several bonus checks.
 Elizabeth  recalls  “I knew for sure that I was going to continue to tithe  no matter what.

 Curry  spent  years with NBC’s morning show  and from  to   she  served as co-anchor alongside Matt Lauer.
 Her  tearful on-air announcement that  she  was leaving is remembered as a landmark moment in morning show television. NBC has long said the decision was based on ratings  and the network declined to comment on Wednesday. But fans and journalists like then-New York Times media critic Brian Stelter  who detailed the tension between Lauer and  Curry  in  his   book “Top of the Morning ” believe Lauer had something to do with her departure.

I do know that it hurt like hell.”
Asked if she thought Lauer – who was fired in November over claims of sexual misconduct – abused his power   Curry  said  “I’m trying to do no harm in these conversations. I can tell you that I am not surprised by the allegations.”
When King asked  Curry  whether  she  “heard things” or “knew things” while  she  was at NBC   Curry  responded: “I’m trying not to hurt people and I know what it’s like to be publicly humiliated. I never did anything wrong to be publicly humiliated  and I don’t want to cause that kind of pain to somebody else.

3602,dev,"Registered nurse Melissa Velez tells Newsmax Health that a trip to the emergency room is warranted if you  a loved one  or your child feel like you are unable to breathe normally  can’t eat  or have a fever that does not go down with medication.
“The most important thing is to stay home  rest and stay hydrated. Drink plenty of clear fluids to prevent dehydration and avoid close contact with others ” says  Velez .  She  advises staying home from work or school and not returning until you have been fever free for at least  hours.
Holistic health coach Deanna Durso echoes  Velez ’s sentiments on the importance of hydration  telling Newsmax Health it’s one of the most important aspects of fighting off the flu.
Experts also suggest lots of rest to fight the flu  but advise not lying flat on your back  which can make it harder to clear your lungs and the position can lead to increased coughing fits.  Velez  suggests lying propped up with a few pillows instead.
 She  adds that grandma’s wisdom about chicken noodle soup being a panacea may be true  but alcohol should be avoided. It can contribute to dehydration and  although it can make you sleepy  it doesn’t lead to quality REM sleep.  She  says alcohol will likely make you feel worse.
 Velez  says the best medication for the flu  other than Tamiflu (which should be taken within the first  hours that symptoms emerge)  is an over-the-counter fever reducer like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Although suitable for adults  these medications are not advised for use in children under age .","['Registered nurse Melissa Velez tells Newsmax Health that a trip to the emergency room is warranted if you  a loved one  or your child feel like you are unable to breathe normally  can’t eat  or have a fever that does not go down with medication.', '“The most important thing is to stay home  rest and stay hydrated.

No.  North Carolina got within five points moments later  but Virginia bumped the margin to  when Kyle Guy came off a screen for a three-pointer  and  Hunter  and Nigel Johnson both made free throws.
 Hunter  finished with  points in  his  second straight game playing as a stretch-four in Coach Tony Bennett’s four-guard lineup.  He  was among six Virginia players who dunked and had the Cavaliers looking far more athletic than North Carolina (-  -)  which lost a second straight game for the first time since February .
“I tracked down the rebound  and I saw the baseline open  and I saw Joel Berry  and I really wanted him to jump ”  Hunter  said of  his  highlight reel jam. “Once I got the ball  I knew I was going to dunk it  so I was hoping he jumped.
The moxie to do so against an accomplished player underscores  Hunter ’s considerable confidence that  according to both  he  and Bennett  comes in part from sitting out last season.
That wasn’t the plan when  Hunter  arrived in Charlottesville  but a high ankle sprain compelled Bennett to eventually decide redshirting would allow the -foot- wing player to focus on getting stronger.  Hunter  spent countless hours in the weight room  and this season the results have been translating onto the court.
“It was a hard decision because we thought  he  possibly could have helped us in certain ways ” Bennett said  “but we thought for  his  physical maturity and development of  his  game   his  ball skills   his  shooting  just going to work like all of our redshirts  we thought it might be the best  maybe not short term for us  but long term for  him  and for us  we thought it was the right decision.”
 Hunter  has scored in double figures in three of  his  past four games  including  in Wednesday night’s - rout of Virginia Tech  which was the largest margin of victory for the Cavaliers in the series since .
 He  added seven rebounds against North Carolina  which committed  turnovers that led to  points. The Tar Heels scored just three points off turnovers  a disparity  Williams  lamented along with blaming  himself  for not having  his  team ready for the Cavaliers’ vaunted defense.
“Their defense was a million times stronger than our offense ”  Williams  said. “We didn’t have very good movement. We sort of tried to go one-on-one way too many times  didn’t get as much as we needed to taking the ball to the basket. Their defense was really good.

3607,dev,"City ethics officials  are looking into whether longtime Ald.  Ed Burke     violated ethics rules when  he  sidelined an effort to increase the property taxes paid by the owners of two buildings  his  law firm represents  according to the alderman whose effort  he  blocked.
Ethics board Executive Director Steve Berlin and Chairman William Conlon neither confirmed nor denied the review  in keeping with city regulations. Neither  Burke  nor  his  spokesman responded to questions Friday.
The  Burke  probe comes after  Ward Ald. Scott Waguespack filed a formal request for the ethics board to look into the matter on Thursday  a day after the Tribune published a story raising the question of whether  Burke  had violated city ethics rules at the Jan.  City Council meeting.
On Munoz’s list are two properties owned by companies for which Burke’s law firm has saved millions of dollars in property taxes by appealing to lower assessments used to determine tax bills. The lower the assessment  the less paid in taxes.
If Munoz’s proposal passed and the city succeeded in increasing assessments  the owners of the seven buildings  including the two represented by Klafter &  Burke   would pay more in property taxes.
Shortly after Munoz introduced his proposal   Burke  put up a potential roadblock.
Munoz had asked that the measure be assigned to the Housing and Real Estate Committee  led by  Ward Ald. Joe Moore  who had planned to give it a hearing.  Burke  intervened  saying the measure instead should be sent to the Finance Committee.
That’s where  Burke  holds great sway as chairman  in part by deciding whether a proposal ever gets a hearing. When there’s a dispute on which committee should consider a measure  the matter automatically goes to the Rules and Ethics Committee  where legislation often withers on the vine.
Munoz and outside ethics experts questioned whether Burke violated city ethics code by “calling Finance.” The code states that “no official or employee shall make or participate in the making of any governmental decision with respect to any matter in which he has any financial interest ” earned money from during the past year or expects to earn money from in the coming year.
“It’s a violation ” said Waguespack of  Burke ’s action  adding that  he  also wants a broader interpretation from the ethics board on what actions violate conflict-of-interest rules. The earlier Tribune story also noted that  Burke  often presides over Finance Committee meetings considering actions that could affect  his  law firm’s clients  but then abstains from voting.
If the ethics board were to find  Burke  violated the city ethics rules   he  could face a fine of between $ and $   according to the code.

3617,dev,"More than decade ago  Shah and a friend  Derek Moeller  hatched a plan for a health information and advertising startup called ContextMedia while students at Northwestern University   Moeller  said.  Moeller  presented the business plan during Professor William White’s engineering and entrepreneurship class.
Both students had an interest in health because of family members with diabetes  and they started planning. “We both had the entrepreneurial bug and we wanted to make something of it ”  Moeller  said.
 Moeller ’s group got an A on the business plan  said White  who later became one of ContextMedia’s directors.
It was spring  and  Moeller  was set to graduate and work in the banking industry. ContextMedia changed his plans. “We were spending so much time on the business and trying to figure out how to launch it and what the model is going to be that we were really primarily focused on that ” he said.
Neither  Moeller  nor Shah received degrees from Northwestern. Agarwal graduated in  with a bachelor’s of science in journalism  according to Northwestern. Outcome Health spokesman John Eddy said Agarwal was involved in the early discussions and helped with the company in the early days  joining it full-time after graduation.
Shah   Moeller  and Agarwal’s skill sets were complementary  said White  who stepped down from the board in .  Moeller  was more involved in finances and operations  Agarwal focused on marketing strategy and Shah pulled it all together and did the direct selling  White said.
It took at least a year for ContextMedia to land a major advertiser   Moeller  said. In those early days  the company was shipping DVDs to doctors’ offices that had their screens installed  and it was focused on endocrinologists  who treat diabetes  among other conditions. “They really enjoyed the idea of having relevant content in their waiting rooms ”  Moeller  said. “At the time  the primary competitor was soap operas. ‘Judge Judy’ was a big one.”
The recession hit around the same time ContextMedia moved into its first real office space in the Loop. That made fundraising harder. The company was not yet profitable and was still working to solidify itself among advertising clients. There were times when one customer accounted for a majority of the company’s revenue   Moeller  said. “That’s the kind of stuff that keeps you up at night ”  he  said.
Near the end of    Moeller  left to buy a Washington-based manufacturing company called McConkey. ContextMedia bought his shares and it was an amicable parting   Moeller  said. He was proud of where ContextMedia was  and McConkey “needed a turnaround ” he said. He added that at that point  Shah wanted to be the primary driver of ContextMedia. “He wanted this to be more his thing ”  Moeller  said.
Soon after  Moeller ’s departure  the company expanded  starting with the launch of its Rheumatoid Health Network. Between  and   ContextMedia increased its network from a few hundred hospitals and clinics to more than    according to a  court filing. Its clients were big companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb  and divisions of ad agencies Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group.","['More than decade ago  Shah and a friend  Derek Moeller  hatched a plan for a health information and advertising startup called ContextMedia while students at Northwestern University   Moeller  said.

3619,dev,"I could have  though  which is one reason it struck me so hard when I read it Thursday. Those are the opening words of the quasi-apology issued by  movie impresario Harvey Weinstein  after The New York Times reported that  he  had sexually preyed on women for the past  years.
According to the Times  Weinstein  one of Hollywood’s most powerful men  invited the actress Ashley Judd to a meeting in  his  hotel room then asked if she’d watch  him  shower.  He  promised another young woman that  he ’d help her career in exchange for sex.  He  asked a female assistant to give  him  a massage while  he  was naked. There were others.
 Weinstein  has denounced the Times report and is threatening to sue  but  he  also issued a mea culpa for unspecified wrongs  he  has done and pain  he  has caused  with the suggestion that  his  problem is rooted in the world that shaped  him .
“That was the culture then ”  he  said in  his  statement.
 Weinstein  was born in   the year before the recently departed Hugh Hefner invented Playboy magazine.  He  grew up in an era when men yukked it up over Playboy playmates  which corresponded to the moment that women  newly liberated by the birth control pill  were finding their way in record numbers into college  grad school and jobs once reserved for men.
How much mercy does  Weinstein  deserve because  he  came into power when men were less likely to be outed for using it in abusive  sexual ways?
 His  adviser in this scandal  the attorney Lisa Bloom  who ordinarily defends women in sexual harassment cases  has called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.”
 We ’re all products of  our  time.  Weinstein  came into adulthood in an age that made it easier for men to kids themselves that harassment was OK. But deep down  I’m guessing   he  always knew it was wrong. Power often seduces people  regardless of gender  into doing whatever they can get away with.
Sexual harassment in the workplace still thrives  from the movie studio to the TV network (think  Fox  and no doubt others) to hot new startups (think Uber) to  well  probably everywhere.

3620,dev,"Dick Enberg  a Hall of Fame broadcaster known as much for  his  excited calls of ""Oh my!"" as the big events  he  covered during a -year career  has died.  He  was .
 Enberg 's daughter  Nicole Enberg Vaz  confirmed the death to The Associated Press. She said the family became concerned when her father didn't arrive Thursday on his flight to Boston  and he was found dead at his home in La Jolla  a San Diego neighborhood  with his bags packed.
His daughter said the family believes  Enberg  died of a heart attack but was awaiting official word.
 Enberg 's wife  Barbara  already was in Boston and was expecting his arrival.
The family ""is grateful for the kind thoughts and prayers of all of Dick's countless fans and dear friends "" according to a statement released by  Enberg 's attorney  Dennis Coleman. ""At this time we are all still processing the significant loss  and we ask for prayers and respectful privacy in the immediate aftermath of such untimely news.""
 Enberg  got  his  big break with UCLA basketball and went on to call Super Bowls  Olympics  Final Fours and Angels and Padres baseball games as well as Rams football games.
 He  retired from  his  TV job with the Padres in October   capping a six-decade career punctuated with countless calls of ""Oh my!"" in describing big plays.  He  also was well known for  his  baseball catchphrase of ""Touch 'em all!"" for home runs.
"" Dick  was an institution in the industry for  years and we were lucky enough to have  his  iconic voice behind the microphone for Padres games for nearly a decade "" Padres owners Ron Fowler and Peter Seidler said in a statement.
 Enberg 's many former broadcast partners included Merlin Olsen  Al McGuire  Billy Packer  Don Drysdale and Tony Gwynn. He even worked a few games with Wooden  whom he called ""The greatest man I've ever known other than my own father.""
 Enberg  called Padres games for seven seasons and went into the broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in  as the recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award.
""There will never be another Dick Enberg "" CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus said. ""As the voice of generations of fans   Dick  was a masterful storyteller  a consummate professional and a true gentleman.  He  was one of the true legends of our business.""

 Enberg  won  Sports Emmy Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Emmy. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  and UCLA named its Media Center in Pauley Pavilion after  Enberg  this year.
At halftime of a UCLA game in February  former Bruins stars Bill Walton and Jamaal Wilkes presented  Enberg  with a No.  jersey  signifying the number of championships he called.

3621,dev,"Renewed interest came this week when the lead detective in the case said her widower  actor Robert Wagner  now   is considered a person of interest.
Wagner wrote in a  memoir that he and Walken argued that night. Walken went to bed and  Wagner  stayed up for a while  he wrote. When he went to bed  he noticed his wife and a rubber dinghy that had been tied to the yacht were missing.
""There are only two possibilities ""  Wagner  wrote  ""either she was trying to get away from the argument  or she was trying to tie the dinghy. But the bottom line is that nobody knows exactly what happened.""
FILE - This Nov.    file photo shows the ""Prince Valiant "" the inflatable dinghy used by Natalie Wood  moored at the harbor in Avalon  Calif.  after it washed up on the rocks on Santa Catalina Island. Patrolmen discovered the actress' body  yards off Blue Cavern Point on Catalina Island   yards away from the boat after a seven hour search. Investigators are now calling her husband  Robert Wagner  a ""person of interest"" in the  death of Wood. Mystery has swirled around Wood's death. It was declared an accident but police reopened the case in  to see whether Wagner or anyone else played a role (AP Photo/Paul J. Harrington  File)
When the case was reopened  Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. John Corina said  Wagner  was not a suspect.
This week  Corina told CBS News that  he  didn't believe  Wagner  had told the whole story about what happened and called  him  a person of interest in the case.
Initially  a sheriff's spokeswoman downplayed the report Thursday and said there was nothing new in the case. But later  the department issued a statement confirming that  Wagner  is a person of interest.
WHAT WALKEN AND  WAGNER  TOLD INVESTIGATORS
Investigators made at least  attempts to interview  Wagner  again after reopening the investigation in   including tracking  him  down in Colorado. But either  Wagner  or  his  lawyer refused.
FILE - In this Dec.     file photo  Robert Wagner  attends The Caucus for Producers  Writers and Directors  Annual Awards in Beverly Hills  Calif. New witnesses have emerged in the  drowning of actress Natalie Wood  prompting investigators to deem it a ""suspicious death"" and name  her former husband  -year-old actor Robert Wagner  a ""person of interest "" Los Angeles sheriff's officials  said  Thursday  Feb.   . For nearly four decades  mystery and speculation have swirled around the death of the actress who was nominated for three Academy Awards and starred in ""West Side Story"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause."" (Photo by Todd Williamson /Invision/AP)
 Wagner 's attorney  Blair Berk  issued a statement five years ago saying neither  Wagner  nor  his  daughters had any new information and blaming people for trying to exploit the  anniversary of Wood's death.

 Lang  said shares of Honeywell may have gotten overheated  but noted a few positives: the pullback happened on lower volume  meaning there aren't any major sellers  and the stock has been holding above its floor of support.
""Put it all together and as far as  Lang 's concerned  Honeywell just needs to re-charge "" Cramer said. ""He could potentially see this $ stock running up to $ near the beginning of the new year  which would be stupendous.""

3635,dev,"When Florida fired Jim McElwain as its football coach  his contract included a stipulation for a $ million buyout. Because of the peculiar circumstances  the school will likely get by with a much lower figure  around $ million. Butch Jones is out at Tennessee with a reported buyout of more than $ million. If Texas A&M were to fire Kevin Sumlin  his buyout is reported at $ million. Rumors are circulating that Arkansas will fire its head coach   Bret Bielema   at the end of the season with a buyout ranging from $ to $ million  depending on the timing.
These large sums generate a lot of head scratching and criticism. For  Bielema  and Jones  their buyouts would be roughly equivalent to a year's pay. For Sumlin  it would be about two years. For McElwain  at the original contracted amount  it approaches three years' worth. In Weis' case  well  it is several.
Of course  the size of the insurance matters. Many of these buyouts diminish through the life of the contract  which complicates comparisons between coaches and players. Had  Bielema  been let go after one year   his  buyout would have amounted to about one-half the total contract value. Now it would be less than half of  his  remaining contract and about one-fifth of the total contract value — figures that are not way out of line with what is seen among NFL players.
What doesn't make sense is giving a player or coach a big insurance policy when they aren't performing very well.  Bielema  received an extension and a new buyout clause coming off less-than-stellar seasons  when  his  market value to other schools would not have been great. The Weis buyout seemed to reflect that Notre Dame way overestimated Weis' value after a single season's improvement.","['When Florida fired Jim McElwain as its football coach  his contract included a stipulation for a $ million buyout.

3636,dev,"Franken  Reiterates  He  Won't Resign: 'I Know That I've Let A Lot Of People Down'
 Sen. Al Franken  said Monday  he  would not resign from office after allegations of sexual harassment have been leveled against  him .
""I know that I've let a lot of people down ""  Franken  said  noting that  he  was looking forward to getting back to work. ""My colleagues  my staff  my supporters and everyone who has counted on  me  to be a champion for women. To all of you  I just want to again say I am sorry. I know there are no magic words I can say to regain your trust.""
 He  said the process will take time and ""that starts with going back to work today.""
The Minnesota Democrat spoke to reporters on Capitol Hill for the first time since multiple women have accused  him  of inappropriate sexual conduct  ranging from forcible kissing to unwanted touching.  He  took a few questions  reiterated that  he  would not resign and expressed remorse and regret.
""I've been trying to take responsibility by apologizing ""  Franken  said.  He  added  ""I'm going to be accountable"" and ""cooperate completely with the ethics investigation.""
 Franken 's conduct has been referred to the Senate Ethics Committee. The committee could recommend anywhere from a reprimand to censure to expulsion  but the full Senate would have to act on that.
Leeanne Tweeden  a radio host in Los Angeles and former model  toured with  Franken  as part of the USO. She recalled  Franken  forcibly kissing her during sketches and rehearsals. A photo taken aboard a cargo plane also shows  Franken  touching Tweeden's breasts over a flak jacket while she was asleep. Looking over  his  shoulder   Franken  smirks at the camera.
 Franken  said  he  didn't remember  his  time with Tweeden the same way  but noted  ""I feel that you have to respect women's experience. I apologized to her  and I meant it. And I was very grateful that she accepted it.""
Women have also accused  Franken  of touching their buttocks while taking photos in Minnesota.  Franken  said  he  does not remember specific instances in which that happened  but  he  did not deny that it did.
""One is too many ""  Franken  said.  He  added that it was disrespectful and  he  is sorry  he  hurt them.
 He  repeated later  ""I am tremendously sorry. ... I am embarrassed. I feel ashamed.""
 Franken 's comments echo what  he  told Minnesota Public Radio News in an interview over the weekend: ""I'm going to go forward. I'm going to take responsibility. I'm going to be held accountable  and I'm going to try to be productive in the way I speak about this.""","[""Franken  Reiterates  He  Won't Resign: 'I Know That I've Let A Lot Of People Down'"", ' Sen.

Bryant  opened up in  his  first lengthy session with reporters in weeks  taking responsibility for a subpar season by saying  he  let frustrations affect  him  during games. But  he  also said some of those frustrations were rooted in the offensive scheme  which  he  said  he  would probably address with owner Jerry Jones and coaches in the offseason.

FRISCO  Texas (AP) —  Dez Bryant  didn't seem sure how to respond when asked if  he  would be willing to take a pay cut after perhaps the most difficult season of the Dallas receiver's career.
Once the  All-Pro came to  his  senses   he  was emphatic.
""Hell no  man ""  Bryant  said Wednesday  three days after the Cowboys were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to Seattle. ""I believe in me.""
 Bryant  opened up in  his  first lengthy session with reporters in weeks  taking responsibility for a subpar season by saying  he  let frustrations affect  him  during games. But  he  also said some of those frustrations were rooted in the offensive scheme  which  he  said  he  would probably address with owner Jerry Jones and coaches in the offseason.
The eighth-year pro also blamed some of  his  struggles on knee tendinitis  something that hadn't been revealed.  Bryant  was listed on the injury report for three weeks earlier in the season  including one week when  he  missed two practices when an ankle injury also was listed.
But  Bryant  didn't miss any games  and is on the verge of going all  without a -yard outing for the first time in  his  career unless  he  sits for a meaningless finale Sunday at Philadelphia. In  his  second season in    Bryant  didn't reach  yards in  games  missing one for injury.
""I consider  myself  a warrior ""  Bryant  said. ""If I can walk  I can move  I'm going to go out there and try to play. That's probably dumb  but hey  that's just who I am. I love this game  and I try to push it  but for the most part  yeah  I have been pretty banged up.""
Injuries are part of the reason  Bryant  hasn't lived up to the $ million  five-year contract  he  signed after  his  All-Pro season.  He  had career lows across the board in  because of foot and ankle issues that kept  him  out of seven games.
A knee injury knocked  him  out of three games last year  but  he  was productive otherwise and capped the season with  yards and two touchdowns in the top-seeded Cowboys' playoff loss to Green Bay.
In the three years before the big contract   Bryant  averaged  catches    yards and  touchdowns per season. With a game  he  might not play remaining  the averages in the three years since are  catches   yards and six TDs.
""I'm a grown man  and I should be able to sit there and have my frustrations in check  regardless of whatever the situation might be ""  Bryant  said. ""All I know is if my mind's not cluttered  I can beat whoever  whenever  anybody at any time. It's just sometimes I let certain things get to me that I shouldn't.""
Offensive coordinator Scott Linehan brushed off  Bryant 's comments about the scheme  saying it's the same one Dallas used on a franchise-record -game winning streak last season during the sensational rookie years for quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott.
 Bryant  has by far the most targets on the team with   but has connected with Prescott just  percent of the time ( catches). Again   Bryant  pointed to the staff  which didn't seem to bother coach Jason Garrett.
The Cowboys could save $. million in cap room by designating Bryant as a post-June  cut. While  Bryant  dismissed as ""dumb"" a question about whether  he  wanted to remain with Dallas   he  didn't ignore the idea of ending up elsewhere.
""If that came about  I'm still  Dez Bryant  ""  he  said. ""I'm still going over the top. If it's there where I can grab it  I'm going to grab it. That's just who I am.""","['FILE - In this Dec.      file photo  Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant ()  runs against the Oakland Raiders during the second half of an NFL football game in Oakland   Calif.

People are talking about making the electrical grid more resilient. That means not only making  it  more reliable  so that  it ’s less likely to fail  but also better at putting  itself  back together if pieces of  it  collapse. I think that this sort of thing deserves at least as much attention as cyberdefense efforts designed to frustrate hackers. All sorts of things besides hackers could bring down the grid: A massive solar flare  an EMP attack  a software “bug” rather than a hack. The better the grid is at recovering  the better it will be if any of them happen.
The Bitcoin bubble bursts:  Bitcoin  has been skyrocketing  and I confess that I wish I’d put  say  a thousand bucks into  it  a few years back  when my crypto-enthusiast friends were encouraging me to. But many people think  it ’s in a bubble  and all bubbles burst. Perhaps they’re wrong  but if they’re right  many people — especially in Asia  where millions of investors are driving up the price according to the Wall Street Journal — will wind up losing their shirts and angry. Asia doesn’t need destabilizing right now  with North Korea and China rattling sabers. (And for added fun  North Korea is hacking  Bitcoin  exchanges.)
There’s not much bankers and regulators can do to stop a bubble bursting  but they should be ready for its possibility. And ordinary folks can prepare by keeping their debt and spending on a tight leash  which is a good idea anyway. Or maybe it’s not a bubble  and I’m missing out by not buying  Bitcoin  even at  its  current soaring price. By way of comfort  that would be consistent with my investment performance.

Zach Hirsch of North Country Public Radio is on the line to talk about the latest developments. Hi  Zach.
MARTIN: New York governor  Andrew Cuomo  had a news conference tonight  and  along with police officials  spoke about how  Richard Matt  was killed. What details did they give?
HIRSCH: So they said there had been these burglaries in the area over the last few days. And then someone reported that their RV was shot at  so police came to that area where they - and they found a cabin where  Richard Matt  had been. And Joseph D'Amico of the New York State Police detailed what happened next.

3645,dev,"A criminal referral from top Senate investigators confirms explosive charges in last weekâs House Intelligence Committee memo regarding abuse of surveillance authorities at the FBI and Department of Justice. It also reveals a host of problems arising from the bureauâs cooperation with  foreign investigator Christopher Steele   who was working on behalf of Hillary Clintonâs presidential campaign. The eight-page memo from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) includes underlying evidence to support the claims.
âIt appears the FBI relied on admittedly uncorroborated information  funded by and obtained for Secretary Clintonâs presidential campaign  in order to conduct surveillance of an associate of the opposing presidential candidate. It did so based on  Mr. Steele âs personal credibility and presumably having faith in his process of obtaining the information. But there is substantial evidence suggesting that  Mr. Steele  materially misled the FBI about a key aspect of  his  dossier efforts  one which bears on  his  credibility â Sens. Graham and Grassley wrote.
The letter describes a verification effort before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) so inadequate it resembles a concerted effort to conceal information from the court. However  the senators blame Steeleâs âapparent deceptionâ for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) failures by FBI and Justice  and refer  Steele  for investigation of violating federal law regarding making false statements to the U.S. government. The letter also reveals Clinton associates were feeding  Steele  allegations that  he  used in  his  reports.
A salacious and unverified dossier formed an essential part of the application to secure a warrant against a Trump campaign affiliate named Carter Page. This application failed to reveal that the dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The application presented a Yahoo News article as corroboration for the dossier  when in fact it was sourced to the dossierâs author Christopher Steele. The wife of a high-ranking Justice Department official also worked on behalf of the Clinton campaign effort  and her husband Bruce Ohr funneled her research into the Department of Justice. Although he admitted that  Steele  âwas desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president â this and the Ohrsâ relationship with the Clinton campaign was concealed from the secret court that grants surveillance warrants. The dossier was âonly minimally corroboratedâ and unverified  according to FBI officials.
Evidence supporting all of these claims is included in a less redacted version of the senatorsâ January     referral made publicly available late Tuesday evening. A highly redacted version of the referral was made publicly available the previous day  causing Grassley to ask the FBI to aim for more transparency. The FBI had previously attempted to keep the public from learning details of its relationship with  Steele   leading Grassley to publicly decry a âbureaucratic game of hide the ballâ by the FBI and DOJ.

The application also mentioned a Yahoo News article  but not only didnât mention the article was sourced to an anonymous  Steele   it positively claimed it wasnât.
Reporter Michael Isikoff recently confirmed that  Steele  was obviously  his  source for the article  and that Clintonâs Russia dossier project head Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS was a longtime friend. The FBI stated to the court that  Steele  had nothing to do with the article. Shopping his unverified allegations to the media was contrary to Steeleâs agreement with the FBI. Even after  Steele  publicly testified about  his  many media contacts  the FBI hid that part of  his  dossier operation from the court and continued to rely on  his  credibility for surveillance reauthorization.

3650,dev,"As news emerged that  President Robert Mugabe  a one-time freedom fighter who has ruled the southern African nation with an iron fist for  years   had resigned  his  post  the streets of Zimbabweâs capital erupted in joy. Through the night  the Zimbabwean capital echoed with exuberant car horn blasts as revelers danced.
In neighboring South Africa  members of the Zimbabwean diaspora celebrated with raucous singing and firework displays. Many of them hold  Mugabe  responsible for their exileâthe country  once the breadbasket of southern Africa  has seen the economy collapse under his rule  sending an estimated three million Zimbabweans across the border in search of employment. âThis is a new beginning for Zimbabwe â beamed Yolanda Nyngana  a -year-old interior designer who works as a housekeeper in Cape Town. â This Mugabe    he  has been so bad for our country. Even people with an education have no jobs  but  his  family has been living off the countryâs wealth for years. We lost everything because of  this man .â
 Mugabe âs resignation capped a tense week that started with the military placing the president under house arrest on Nov. . Though the move had all the markings of a coup  military leaders insisted that they were instead clearing out the âcriminalsâ that had undermined the presidentâs leadership  most likely a reference to supporters of his wife  Grace Mugabe  who has been angling to succeed the -year-old in the presidency.
Protestors took to the streets when the President refused to step down  prompting  his party  to suspend him  and parliament to launch impeachment proceedings. As the initial proceedings concluded in parliament on Nov.   members of Mugabeâs cabinet rushed in with a letter of resignation from the President. âMy decision to resign â¦. arises from my concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe and my desire to ensure a smooth  peaceful and non-violent transfer of power that underpins national security  peace and stability â the President wrote. As the speaker of the house read it aloud  parliamentarians cheered.
Thatâs because many feel that  Mugabe âs successor  former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa  will carry on much as before when  he  is sworn in on Friday. The two worked side by side for much of the Presidentâs reign. In a diplomatic cable posted on Wikileaks in   the U.S. State Department noted that Mnangagwa was âwidely feared and despised throughout the countryâ and âcould be an even more repressive leaderâ than  Mugabe .  He  remains on the U.S. sanctions list  along with General Constantino Chiwenga  the military leader who helped push  Mugabe  out of power  for  his  role in repressing democracy in Zimbabwe. Kenneth Roth  the executive director of Human Rights Watch  tweeted photos of  Mugabe  and Mnangagwa next to each other. âZimbabweâs dictator finally resigns. Now donât replace him with another.â
He was appointed vice president in   and  at the time  was widely assumed to be  Mugabe âs chosen successor. It was Mugabeâs abrupt dismissal of Mnangagwa  on Nov.   that precipitated the militaryâs intervention. While  Mugabe  cited disloyalty  most in government saw it as an attempt by  Grace Mugabe  to insert herself into the succession race by taking  his  place as vice president. At this point  Ms. Mugabeâs whereabouts are unknown.
Interior designer-turned-housemaid Nyngana agrees. âAnyone is better than  Mugabe  â she says. More to the point  the threat of upcoming elections is likely to keep Mnangagwa in line  and force him to implement at least some of the changes Zimbabweans want to see. Inflation is so high in Zimbabwe at the moment that relatives ask her to send groceries home from South Africa instead of money. âIf Mnangagwa wants to win  he will make sure that people can afford cooking oil again  at the very least â she says. She might even head home for the elections  her first trip back in nearly three years. âI was never interested in voting before  because we already knew who was going to win. This time I can choose the person who I think is best for Zimbabwe.â And  if all goes well  the person after that.","['As news emerged that  President Robert Mugabe  a one-time freedom fighter who has ruled the southern African nation with an iron fist for  years   had resigned  his  post  the streets of Zimbabweâ\x80\x99s capital erupted in joy.

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady  in the midst of another controversy  deflected in a news conference Thursday when asked multiple questions about an ESPN story that depicted  Brady  as being celebratory when New England traded former backup Jimmy Garoppolo in October.
âNot to us players  I think â  Brady  said when asked if reaction to the article has become a distraction. âWe do what we always do and show up to work and try to do the best we can do. Thereâs a lot at stake and I think everyone has put a lot into it.
The ESPN story depicted discord among  Brady   coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft  with a hint that the dysfunction could ultimately bring an end to the trioâs working relationship at some point. As the Patriots gear up for Saturdayâs divisional-round playoff game against the Tennessee Titans and look to defend their Super Bowl championship  the focus for many outside the organization is on the teamâs future beyond this season
âI think we have a job to do and we know what that job is and itâs to go out and play football at a high level and play well â  Brady  continued. âNothing really should get in the way of that. Thatâs what we get paid for  to be a professional and put everything aside and go out there and do the best you can for the team and try to win.â
Previously in a radio show on Tuesday   Brady  called the articleâs portrayal of  Brady  celebrating the Garoppolo trade a âpoor characterization.â
The article came at a time when Brady  who turned  years old in August  had endured some recent struggles. In the span from Week  to    Brady  threw six interceptions. Before that stretch   he  had only thrown two.
Earlier this week   Brady âs camp also released a trailer for a documentary that takes a closer look at  Brady âs personal life  Tom vs. Time.
âThatâs a good question â  Brady  said when asked what  he  hoped viewers would get out of it. âThis is about Tennessee. Weâre two days out from the biggest game of the year.

3653,dev,"Germanyâs Social Democrats backed formal coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel after a divisive party convention  marking a potential breakthrough toward her fourth term.
 Merkel  hailed the âpositive resultâ in Bonn before meeting with fellow leaders of  her  CDU in Berlin to lay out the negotiating path ahead. With coalition talks able to begin as soon as Tuesday  the end of a four-month political stalemate is on the horizon  enabling  Merkel  to move toward re-inauguration possibly by mid-March. The euro rose in early Asian trading.
Sundayâs convention had been seen as the biggest obstacle to  Merkel âs plan to govern with the SPD   her  partner of the past four years. Yet the vote was carried only after pledges by the leadership to win greater concessions from  Merkelâs  bloc in the talks to come. The upshot is that the partyâs decision to give its members the final say over any coalition pact is emerging as a bigger-than-expected hurdle to a renewal of the grand coalition.
Five hours of impassioned debate pitted establishment figures against young and leftist grass-roots members  who rejected governing with  Merkel  in favor of a period of renewal in opposition. Kevin Kuehnert  head of the SPDâs youth wing  argued that such a course âcan be the beginning of a new story that we write together.â
Schulz  who led the SPD to its worst result since World War II in Septemberâs inconclusive election  made the case for another tie-up by pledging to press  Merkel âs bloc for expanded commitments on health care  hardship rules for refugees who want to bring family members to Germany and curbing layoffs of temporary workers.
A go-ahead from party members is far from guaranteed  said Matthias Miersch  head of the SPDâs left-wing caucus.  Merkel âs bloc ânow has to shiftâ on policy  he said.
 Merkel  is already returning to the world stage  visiting French President Emmanuel Macron last Friday and scheduling her first speech in three years to the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  for Wednesday.

It was the kind of routine speech that Senate leaders give every week. And itâs now fueling a massive right-wing hate fest against  Schumer .
On Thursday  the Daily Wireâs Ben Shapiro published a piece with the provocative title âRACISM IN ACTION:  Schumer : I Wonât Vote For This Judge Because Heâs White.â Itâs not an honest piece or an even remotely accurate one  but boy did it pop in certain dark corners of the Internet! According to NewsWhip  a service that monitors news traffic across various media outlets  Shapiroâs claim that  Schumer  is the Real Racistâ¢ was briefly the hottest story on the Internet.
Shapiro builds his piece around a selectively edited video. That video cuts off earlier parts of the speech  where  Schumer  notes that the only reason why Trump was able to nominate someone to fill this vacant seat is âbecause two Republican senators from South Carolina refused to return a blue slip for two judges nominated for the same vacancy by President Obama.â
After expressing concern about this double standard   Schumer  also raised a second objection. âThe nomination of Marvin Quattlebaum speaks to the overall lack of diversity in President Trumpâs selections for the federal judiciary â  Schumer  noted. âAs of February    percent of the President Trumpâs confirmed nominees were male   percent were white.â
In any event  if  Schumer  actually were refusing to vote for Quattlebaum simply because the newly confirmed judge is white  that would be a major shift by the minority leader. Besides Quattlebaum  the Senate confirmed a total of  Trump nominees to federal district courts.  Schumer  voted for  of these  nominees â Quattlebaum is  his  first ânoâ vote. All of the ten nominees  Schumer  supported  according to the Federal Judicial Center  are white.
The problem here  in other words  isnât that  Schumer  wonât support any white people named to the federal bench. Itâs that Trump  who once claimed that a sitting federal judge could not be fair because of the judgeâs âMexican heritage â appears unwilling to name virtually any judges who arenât white.","['On Wednesday   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)  gave a brief speech where  he  criticized Senate Republicans for applying different rules to Trump judicial nominees than they applied to President Obamaâ\x80\x99s  chided Donald Trump for naming almost exclusively white judges  and announced that  he  would not vote for Marvin Quattlebaum  a newly confirmed district judge.

3659,dev,"Three weeks into the  school year  Lewis  who was still on crutches and needed surgery  says she met  Ahmad Ali Bradshaw   a West Point quarterback who was best friends with her roommate.
One night  as Lewis later told West Point investigators  she came back to her room after a shower.  Bradshaw  was there and  she claimed   he  raped her.
 Bradshaw  denied having any sexual contact with Lewis at all  according to an internal investigation report obtained by The Daily Beast.  Bradshaw  also chose to not render an official statement and invoked  his  right to remain silent.
West Pointâs internal investigation concluded that a consensual sexual relationship between the cadets had occurred  and a second investigation  by the Army Criminal Investigation Division and the Staff Judge Advocate  found there was âinsufficient evidenceâ to charge  Bradshaw  with sexual assault.
 Bradshaw  declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by a Daily Beast reporter  and West Point denied an interview with  Bradshaw   saying in an email that it was a âreally busy time given the classroom environment and the upcoming Army Navy activities.â
The annual rivalry game is Saturday and  Bradshaw   a team captain  is expected to start as quarterback.
Despite  Bradshaw âs denial of sex  West Pointâs internal investigation led by Maj. Damon M. Torres concluded that a sexual relationship between the cadets had indeed occurred  but Torres called it consensual. It is unclear from the documents how Torres arrived at that conclusion  and West Point declined to share specifics  citing privacy for both parties.
Nevertheless   Bradshaw  was charged with a violation of Article  of the Cadet Disciplinary Code for improper use of government facilities by way of âsexual activity  which includes  but is not limited to: kissing  hand holding  and fondling â according to West Point regulations.
Torres recommended  Bradshaw  be punished with a Brigade Board  one of the most serious blemishes a cadet can receive on their record  and be enrolled in the Respect Mentorship Program  according to West Point documents viewed by The Daily Beast. The program is designed to âeducate cadets on moral-ethical topics  to challenge them with critical thinking experiences  and to provide structured reflection.â
A second investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division and the Staff Judge Advocate  who advises West Point leaders on legal matters  found there was âinsufficient evidenceâ to charge  Bradshaw  with sexual assault.  Bradshaw  was suspended from football for the duration of the criminal investigation  West Point told The Daily Beast in an email. West Point had previously attributed  his  absence from the field to âan unspecified Academy matter .â
People were writing that she should be âtaken out backâ and shot  âlike Old Yeller â according to screenshots viewed by The Daily Beast. Other cadets called Lewis âthe whore of the corps â and said  Bradshaw âs suspension had cost them the Army-Navy game in . When Lewis complained to  her  superiors  the cadets just took their chatter to a private Facebook group   she  says.
Meanwhile   Bradshaw  became West Pointâs star quarterback. He scored the game-winning touchdown against Navy last year  breaking Armyâs -game losing streak to its archrival.
But perhaps  Bradshaw  shouldnât have been playing at all.
According to a document provided by the Army source   Bradshaw  has been the subject of numerous negative conduct reports besides the one involving Lewisâeven violating West Pointâs famed honor code for cheating in   which should have seen  him  benched for the  fall season but did not.
West Point separated  cadets in    for honor violations and  for other misconduct conduct.  Bradshaw  was not among them despite being found guilty of âlying/cheatingâ by a Cadet Honor Committee at West Point in May .

3662,dev,"U.S. District Court Chief Judge Ruben Castillo  told the Tribune on Friday that if the shutdown happens  the courts have enough money in reserve to keep operating normally into the first week of February.
âBut after that  thatâs where we run into problems â  he  said in a telephone interview. âWe would have to put together a contingency plan to figure out what we would need to do.â
 Castillo  said the first thing that would likely happen in a fiscal emergency would be to âshut down trials â particularly in civil cases.
Trials are expensive to run because jury pools have to be assembled and the courts pay travel and other expenses to jurors  sometimes for weeks at a time   he  said.
Other contingency plans include furloughing nonessential court employees and canceling criminal trials for defendants who are not in custody when there is no danger of violating the accusedâs constitutional right to a speedy trial   Castillo  said.
âYou end up triaging justice  and thatâs just not fair â  he  said.
Itâs not the first time  Castillo  has had to deal with this issue.  He  had been on the job for less than three months when the  shutdown occurred.
 Castillo  told the Tribune then that if the stalemate hadnât been resolved   he  was prepared to send a doomsday email that would have halted all trials at the busy downtown courthouse because  he  had no more money to pay jurors and court-appointed attorneys or cover other costs of a trial.

3664,dev,"Angelika Graswald  was facing the possibility of a life sentence nearly three years ago. But four days before Christmas    she  walked out of Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York state  focusing on rebuilding  her  life.
 Graswald  made headlines when  she  was charged with murder in the second degree and manslaughter in the second degree in the drowning of  her  fiancÃ©  Vincent Viafore. She pleaded not guilty.
The then -year-old was living with Viafore in Poughkeepsie  New York. Both had been married before. They planned to tie the knot on a beach on the Baltic Sea in  her  home country  Latvia.
Courtesy Angelika Graswald
On their return back across the river several hours later   Graswald  said Viafore  who wasnât wearing a life jacket  capsized in the rough waves and drowned. Prosecutors claimed  Graswald  was responsible for his death because  she  had removed a connector ring from his paddle and the drain plug from the kayak.
After an -hour police interrogation   Graswald  was arrested.  She  was officially indicted for second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in May  after Viaforeâs body was recovered from the river  and pleaded not guilty to both charges.
Weeks before the case was set to go to trial   Graswald  reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to the lesser felony charge of criminally negligent homicide in July   in which  she  admitted  she  should have perceived the risks associated with being out on the water that day.
On Nov.      Graswald  was sentenced to one and a half to four years in state prison  the maximum allowed for criminally negligent homicide  in Vincent Viafore's death.

 Beal  turned a Tuesday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers into  his  personal masterpiece: driving the lane to attack the rim  using  his  body to shield off defenders and clearing space in the midrange and rising without hesitation from deep beyond the three-point arc. By the end   Beal  had crafted the finest scoring game of  his  career  helping the Wizards move past one of the worst moments in franchise history.
Throughout this night of redemption  the Wizards played with improved defense and showed bench depth inside Moda Center. But this one was mostly about  Beal   who scored  points while leading the Wizards (-) back into the light.
 Beal âs night will live in Portland lore as the most points ever scored by a visiting opponent  surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  who scored  against the Blazers as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks on Oct.   .
 Beal  shed his protective glasses and put on his playmaker persona and  for the first time in five games  looked more like himself.
The absence of John Wall had forced  Beal  to find shots for teammates  but the role greatly affected  his  own play as  he  produced glaring negative plus-minus numbers in four of the five games without  his  starting point guard. But  Beal   who had worn glasses during the previous two games  returned to his shooting guard ways. He aggressively searched for his shot to the benefit of the teamâs offense while the rest of the starters remained in a shooting malaise. In by far his best game since Wall has been out of the lineup   Beal  made  of  shots  also career-high marks.
âI came into the game with the mind-set of being aggressive â  Beal  said. âStart to finish. Especially coming off the game  night and the way I played the previous four or five games before that. I wasnât happy about that.
âTonight I was just playing freely â  Beal  said  âand having fun  ultimately. I kind of knew at halftime that it was going to be a good one but I didnât think it was going to be a  pointer.â
While  Beal  dominated the shots  and rightfully so  the remaining four starters made only  of  attempts from the field. But on this night  no one complained about shots. Teammates egged on  Beal  to go for  points â even before  he  had reached  â and following the game  they waited for  Beal  to enter the visitorsâ locker room before dousing  him  in a surprise water attack.
âBrad made history today â said center Marcin Gortat  who shadowed  Beal  throughout the game to create slivers of daylight for Bealâs jumpers. âI was glad I was able to contribute with a few screens  a few assists. We were witnessing history today.â
Although the third quarter proved to be more competitive with Portland outscoring Washington -   Beal  remained unstoppable.  He  played the entire quarter and connected on  of  shots for  points while the rest of the team managed three field goals.
 Beal  remained on the floor at the start of the final quarter and soon eclipsed  his  previous career mark â swishing a shot from  feet . Though  Beal  faced several defenders  but never consistent double-teams   he  found success.
Just before the closing minute   he  dribbled around the perimeter before noticing lanky center Zach Collins standing in  his  way.  Beal  calmly pulled up and drained another three-pointer   his  fifth of the game. Then  with help from Oubre poking away his fifth steal   Beal  added the punctuation to  his  night with a breakaway two-handed slam in the final seconds.
âI was really upset with the way we played  especially with myself individually â  Beal  said of the loss in Utah. âI just came in with the mind-set today that I was going to be aggressive  not thinking about anything else but trying to get a win and playing my game.â","['After the Washington Wizards experienced a night they would rather forget   Bradley Beal  single-handedly provided new memories.', ' Beal  turned a Tuesday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers into  his  personal masterpiece: driving the lane to attack the rim  using  his  body to shield off defenders and clearing space in the midrange and rising without hesitation from deep beyond the three-point arc.

 Kelly Davis  was in Baltimore Circuit Court on Monday  bracing for the worst.  Her  husband  Keith Davis Jr.  was either going to be sentenced to prison for a homicide  he  had denied committing or granted a new trial.
The future of  her  family hung in the balance.
Prosecutors had alleged that  Keith Davis     was responsible for the  shooting death of a security guard.  He  was convicted in October  and  he  was facing a sentence of  years in prison.
But after the trial   Davis âs lawyer  Latoya Francis-Williams  said she discovered that a prosecution witness  a fellow inmate at the prison where  Davis  was held  wasnât exactly reliable.
The inmate  who testified that  Davis  bragged about being a killer  was  in Francis-Williamsâs words  a âgangland enforcer and a notable serial killerâ who âevidence suggests . . . has been parading around the country testifying in homicide cases in order to gain leniency for  his  gruesome crimes.â
On Monday  Judge Lynn Stewart Mays found that prosecutors had inappropriately âsanitizedâ the inmateâs background. Instead of carrying on with the sentencing  she granted  Davis  a new trial.
 Kelly Davis  rushed from the courtroom  ecstatic over the judgeâs ruling. But she was still shaken by the close call.
âIf I wasnât living through this  if it wasnât happening in my life  I wouldnât believe it â said  Davis   a human resources specialist.
Baltimore police first arrested  Keith Davis  in June . They alleged that he tried to rob a taxi driver and then fled on foot.  Davis  said  he  saw police running toward  him   so  he  ran  too  because  he  was afraid.  He  has always maintained  he  was a victim of mistaken identity.
In an attempt to apprehend  Davis   police fired  shots  three of which hit  Davis  and left  him  unconscious  according to a police report.
At the October  trial on the robbery charge  the taxi driver testified that  Davis  did not look like the person who had tried to rob him.
Francis-Williams could not pin the officers down on who had been the first to reach  Davis  after the shooting. Two different officers claimed to have been the first on the scene; two different officers said they had been the one to handcuff  Davis .
A jury acquitted  Davis  on all but one charge â gun possession.
But  Davis  said  he  had no weapon on  him .  He  testified that  he  thought police had planted the gun on  him  after  he  had been shot. That scenario may not be hard for many to believe in light of the Baltimore Public Defenderâs Office releasing a video in July of a Baltimore police officer allegedly planting drugs at a crime scene.
Yet  after the robbery trial  Baltimore police and prosecutors alleged that the gun they found was tied to an earlier shooting. Kevin Jones  who worked as a security guard at Pimlico racetrack  was shot five hours before  Davis  was alleged to have robbed the taxi driver.  Davis  was charged with first-degree murder.","['Keith Davis Jr. and Kelly Holsey Davis are shown in a June  photo taken in the visiting area at the Jessup Correctional Facility in Jessup  Md.  where  Keith Davis  is being held without bond.

âThereâs a stench right now and how long will the smell stay around  that âs  really the question â said Gary Fechter  an attorney with McCarter & English who has represented companies in sponsorship deals. âPeople either want to look away or donât want to be reminded of it.â
 Nassar  was sentenced on Wednesday to up to  years in prison at the end of a weeklong hearing. A parade of victims told their stories in raw and unflinching terms  describing how  he  used medical treatments to justify penetrating their bodies with  his  fingers.
 He  worked for the federation through four Olympic Games  but the allegations did not come to light until .
Well-known Olympic medalists including Gabby Douglas and Aly Raisman also publicly accused  Nassar  of sexually abusing them  with Raisman in court calling the federation ârotten from the inside.â
USA Gymnastics will be in the news again next week when  Nassar  is due to be sentenced on similar charges in a different Michigan court. The group still faces litigation from scores of victims accusing it of inaction in the face of years of complaints  and U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun has called for the entire board to resign.  
AT&T Inc (T.N) on Tuesday suspended its sponsorship with USAG  citing the Nassar scandal  saying the federation needed to be rebuilt.
 Some of Nassarâs victims  cheered the companies that cut  their  sponsorships.
âI am deeply grateful for the sponsors of USAG like AT&T who have heard the voices of  the victims  and say no more â said Rachael Denhollander on Wednesday. She was the first to come forward publicly with allegations against Nassar.","['DETROIT (Reuters) -  The scandal stemming from longtime USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassarâ\x80\x99s sexual abuse of young female athletes  could take a financial toll on the sports federation for years  sponsorship executives said.', 'The group already stands to lose millions of dollars in revenue through the  Olympic Games  as sponsors back away after a week of emotional testimony detailing  Nassarâ\x80\x99s  crimes against star athletes  the executives said.', 'â\x80\x9cThereâ\x80\x99s a stench right now and how long will the smell stay around  that â\x80\x99s  really the question â\x80\x9d said Gary Fechter  an attorney with McCarter & English who has represented companies in sponsorship deals. â\x80\x9cPeople either want to look away or donâ\x80\x99t want to be reminded of it.â\x80\x9d', ' Nassar  was sentenced on Wednesday to up to  years in prison at the end of a weeklong hearing.

3677,dev,"President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped Michigan billionaire and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos as  his  choice for education secretary  a move that has prompted a flurry of praise and backlash from either political side throughout the week.
 DeVos   a fierce proponent of school vouchers allowing students to use public funds to attend private schools  heads up the nonprofit American Federation for Children and is a former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party.
 She  has been active in politics for almost  years  since  she  began volunteering for President Gerald Ford in   and has since served on the Republican National Committee  the Alliance for School Choice  and the Foundation for Excellence in Education.
Trump  who supports vouchers and charter schools  called  DeVos  a ""brilliant and passionate education advocate.""
 DeVos  is still a relatively unknown name at the national level  but  she  has become a prominent and polarizing figure in Michigan  where  she  fought for years against charter school regulation.
 She  helped pass the state's charter school law in   and  she  later funded a ballot initiative in  that would have enshrined a right to vouchers in the state's constitution.  Her  advocacy has made  her  appointment a lightning rod for Democrats  while Republicans who opposed Trump's candidacy  such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush  have heaped praise on the move.
The Michigan Democratic Party released a statement calling  DeVos  a ""dangerous and ill-advised pick"" and an ""anti-public education activist "" accusing  her  of attacking the state's public school system and its teachers for the sake of profits of investors in charter schools.
""Here is someone  in Betsy DeVos  who has made it  her  life's work to channel  her  family's massive wealth toward destroying Michigan's public education system "" the party said in a statement.
I am honored to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again. The status quo in ed is not acceptable. â Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) November   
But DeVos has also attracted criticism from some conservatives because of her association with organizations that have supported the Common Core education standards.

3678,dev,"Throwdown's '"" center   Mootyy  is in my crosshairs.  He  has extensive competitive  gaming experience dating back to  his  team's thrilling run in the  All-Star Tournament. I've watched a number of  his  team's  games and focused a great deal on what appears to be  his  strengths and weaknesses.
Here is a reminder: just because  he 's the first big I've spotlighted doesn't mean  he 's the best big-man prospect I've seen. At any rate  here is the assessment.
Big men have a primary responsibility to protect the paint and few I've seen thus far do it as well as  Mootyy .  He  takes pride in rejecting opponents and trying to limit them to one shot.  He  has a high  Pro-Am and hoops IQ  which serves as a major asset to  him  and  his  team.
I heard him say during one of his teammate's streams  ""you guys know  I don't care about stats. I want to win."" Some people say that and still jack up ill-advised shots on one or two contesting defenders. From what I saw  that's not  Mootyy . He's a willing passer but also doesn't hesitate to take the shots he should when the ball swings his way.
His big-time corner three-point shot in the All-Star tournament is proof  Mootyy  can and has stepped up with the pressure on and the controller in his hands.
Like many NBA  League hopefuls   Mootyy  can be a little sharp with  his  tongue. We don't know how the NBA  League broadcasts will be set up and how much of the player's audio will be accessible  but he and others may have to clean up their language when things go live.
The great thing about  Mootyy  is that he understands he appears capable of flipping the professional switch. He does a pretty good job of using his Twitter and other socials as a platform to further market himself.
 Mootyy  would be a great pick for a team with proven ball handlers  shot creators and/or knock-down shooters. His ability to anchor a defense could set a team up for success on that end of the floor. On offense  his willingness to sacrifice shots for the betterment of the team is only augmented by his ability to step up and make them when his number is called.","['Throwdown\'s \'"" center   Mootyy  is in my crosshairs.

Stephanie put a hand to her motherâs face.  Rosemarie âs skin was cold   her  eyes glazed over.

They found her at the Sunrise ICU. It was past  a.m.  the sun high in a flawlessly blue desert sky.  Rosemarie âs face was bruised and swollen   her  abdomen still open from the first of two surgeries to repair  her  vital organs  and  she  had countless tubes coming out of  her  body.
â She  looked bad. Terrible bad â he recalled. But he thought to his wife: âOkay. You survived. Youâre here.â
Days later  the torturous not-knowing of those initial hours has given way to a dull  anxious ache.  Rosemarie  remains on life support and fragile. The doctors say  her  prognosis is good  that  she âs expected to make a full recovery. But when Steve asks when  she âll get off the ventilator  they say theyâre not sure yet. When he asks when  she âll come home  they say theyâre not sure yet.
Steve looks at his wife of  years and wants to lie down beside  her   hold  her  in his arms and tell  her  how much he loves  her . But the doctors tell him itâs better if he doesnât touch  her  too much. Being agitated isnât good for  her  condition. He contents himself with a kiss on  her  forehead and a whisper in  her  ear.
For Stephanie  who used to chat with  her  mother every day  âitâs hard to talk and not hear anything back.â So sometimes  she  says nothing at all  just sits in the chilly  dimly lit hospital room and prays.
Daily  they get reminders of their relative good fortune. On Tuesday  after giving an interview to a local TV station  Paige got a message over Instagram from a woman who said she knew the man who saved her mom. Within minutes  the family was videochatting with Don Matthews  a retired Los Angeles firefighter who remained with  Rosemarie  throughout the shooting  then carried  her  to an ambulance on a ripped up piece of fence.
Everyone on that call cried. They hung up after agreeing that Matthew would come back to Las Vegas for a reunion once  Rosemarie  was out of the ICU.

3682,dev,"Megyn Kelly 's ""Today"" show momentum is keeping  her  from joining NBC coverage in South Korea of the Winter Olympics  Us Weekly reported  citing a source who may have been pushing back at snark from  her  former employer Fox News.
While NBC announced the ""Today"" show was sending Al Roker  Natalie Morales  Willie Geist  Craig Melvin and Dylan Dreyer to South Korea for two weeks for the Olympics  it said  Kelly  will stay in New York City and interview athletes stateside  Deadline.com reported.
In a story published on Thursday  Us Weekly cited a source saying  Kelly 's absence at the Olympics wasnât a dig at  her  but an effort to keep  her   a.m. show on the upswing after riding a surge of momentum from  her  coverage of sexual misconduct related to the #MeToo movement.
""The show is experiencing such momentum that it just made sense to keep it in New York with Kathie Lee and Jenna Bush Hager to follow at  a.m. "" the source told Us Weekly  adding that  Kelly  welcomed the move.
"" She  was game to do whatever the network bosses felt was best but felt very strongly about staying in New York given the topics  her  show has been covering.  She  didn't want to miss out on another big exclusive by being overseas since  her  show has been leading the way on #MeToo interviews.""
Some have questioned the decision by NBC to leave  Kelly  in New York during the Olympics  with  her  former employer Fox News calling it an ""embarrassment"" for  her .
""It was already bad enough that they weren't sending the star they're paying $ million a year to Pyeonchang "" a source close to NBC told Fox News. ""But now they're bringing in a nonemployee to fill a vacancy. Yeah  one wonders what's up with that and how  Kelly  feels about all of this.""
Fox News media analyst Jeffrey McCall called NBC's decision about  Kelly  and Couric ""really confusing.""
""There could be several reasons for not putting  Megyn Kelly  in this role  but surely some other established or up-and-coming NBC personality could manage these duties in a professional fashion "" McCall told Fox News. ""That would allow NBC to boost the brand of that personality for future high-profile occasions.""","['Megyn Kelly \'s ""Today"" show momentum is keeping  her  from joining NBC coverage in South Korea of the Winter Olympics  Us Weekly reported  citing a source who may have been pushing back at snark from  her  former employer Fox News.', 'While NBC announced the ""Today"" show was sending Al Roker  Natalie Morales  Willie Geist  Craig Melvin and Dylan Dreyer to South Korea for two weeks for the Olympics  it said  Kelly  will stay in New York City and interview athletes stateside  Deadline.com reported.', ""In a story published on Thursday  Us Weekly cited a source saying  Kelly 's absence at the Olympics wasnât a dig at  her  but an effort to keep  her   a.m. show on the upswing after riding a surge of momentum from  her  coverage of sexual misconduct related to the #MeToo movement."", '""The show is experiencing such momentum that it just made sense to keep it in New York with Kathie Lee and Jenna Bush Hager to follow at  a.m. "" the source told Us Weekly  adding that  Kelly  welcomed the move.', '"" She  was game to do whatever the network bosses felt was best but felt very strongly about staying in New York given the topics  her  show has been covering.

The former secretary of state and her husband  former President Bill Clinton  benefited from Weinsteinâs donations for more than two decades.  Weinstein  donated in the range of $  to $  to The Clinton Foundation through June   according to the nonprofitâs website.
 Weinstein  was a bundler â someone who collects money from others after donating the maximum legal personal contribution to a candidate â for both Clinton and Obama. Heâs given a total of $   to federal candidates  parties and PACs in all election cycles since   according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Former President Barack Obama has yet to comment on  Weinstein . Obama has appeared at several fundraisers  Weinstein  hosted  praising the Hollywood bigwig for his âamazingâ movies at one such event in . Malia Obama  the former presidentâs eldest daughter  interned at The Weinstein Company earlier this year.
Former Vice President Joe Biden  an outspoken advocate for victims of sexual assault  also hasnât addressed the  Weinstein  scandal.
Representatives for both Obama and Clinton did not immediately return HuffPostâs requests for comment. A representative for Biden declined to comment  as did Sitrick and Company  the high-profile PR crisis firm representing  Weinstein .
On Tuesday  The New Yorker published an explosive report that took the accusations against  Weinstein  even further. Thirteen women interviewed for the story claimed  he  sexually harassed or assaulted them between the  and . Three of the women allege  Weinstein  raped them.
One woman  Lucia Evans  told the magazine she was forced to perform oral sex on  Weinstein  in  at the New York office building for Miramax  the film production company  he  then ran with  his  brother.
âI said  over and over  âI donât want to do this  stop  donât â â Evans told the magazine. â He âs a big guy.  He  overpowered me. ... I just sort of gave up. Thatâs the most horrible part of it  and thatâs why  he âs been able to do this for so long to so many women: People give up  and then they feel like itâs their fault.â
The Times report prompted the board of The Weinstein Company  a film studio  Weinstein  founded with his brother in   to fire him on Sunday.
Some Democratic lawmakers  including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  quickly condemned  Weinstein  after the initial Times story and said they would be donating to charities campaign contributions from  him .
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) announced Friday that she would donate the $  she received from  Weinstein  to a California-based charity that advocates for womenâs equality.
The Times published an editorial Friday asking major Democratic players  including Obama and the Clintons  to weigh in on the  Weinstein  reports.

3684,dev,"I'm nervous as we settle into our seats at the PrivateBank Theatre in Chicago.  Hamilton  is going to be loud. The tickets were expensive. I'm not sure my kids can stay up this late.

Walking through the theater in bright green headphones is not ""normal."" But that simple tool turned a trip to see  Hamilton  into a magical  joyful experience for all of us. Instead of demanding my son conform to the environment  we're giving him the tools to control his environment.
 Hamilton   as I've written before  is particularly important to my son. Something about the music and lyrics sparks him to experiment with his own sounds and words. It's helped him with his own communication strategies as we have embarked on our slow  gorgeous process of finding ways for us to communicate. I will never forget the day he surprised me at breakfast by saying  in time to the music  ""Awesome  wow.""
But enough about bathrooms. Back to  Hamilton .
My son has perfected the art of dancing without leaving his chair. At  Hamilton   I watch as he sways in time to the music  moves his hands in mimicry of the actors on stage  and yet keeps from banging other patrons or making too much noise. As I watch him  I regret how long it took us to buy these bright green lifesavers. As his reaction to certain kinds of sounds intensified over the past few years  I was too slow to give him this simple tool. I just tried to convince him that ""it would be OK"" to walk past the blaring hand dryer. It wasn't OK. Now he doesn't have to put up with the sound  but can still dry his hands.
We made it to the end of the show  though both kids were exhausted by the time of the final bow  and we quickly slipped out into the night. Outside  he handed me his headphones  pointed up at the bright golden marquee  and said  ""Bye Hamilton.""","[""I'm nervous as we settle into our seats at the PrivateBank Theatre in Chicago.

 Zeman  accepted Babisâs resignation on Wednesday but then immediately asked  him  to form another government  giving  him  a political mandate to negotiate with other parties.
The two leaders have shelved past disputes to become political allies.  Zeman  had pledged to ask Babis to head another coalition  putting pressure on other parties to cooperate  while Babis and ANO endorsed  Zeman  in this weekendâs presidential election run-off.
 Zeman  said on Wednesday  he  would provide time for Babis to cobble together a majority in the -seat lower house of parliament  where ANO only holds  seats.
But  he  said that in case  he  lost this weekendâs election   he  would appoint Babis as prime minister again anyway before  his  term ends on March . âThere will be quite a short time for finding the necessary votes  so I will not insist on this condition â  Zeman  said at a joint news briefing with Babis.

After a few players experienced travel delays  the US will have its first practice with full attendance Saturday ahead of the tournament opener Feb.  against Slovenia.  Granato  waited for all  his  players to arrive before convening  his  first meeting to talk about late general manager Jim Johannson  who died unexpectedly last month at .

3695,dev,"A Super Bowl ad for Dodge Ram trucks using one of Martin Luther King Jr.'s last sermons  drew a backlash on social media and a rebuke from some of the civil rights leader's loved ones while winning support from others.

The King Center in Altlanta immediately condemned  the ad   asserting in a tweet that neither it nor King's daughter  Bernice King  ""is the entity that approves the use of #MLK's words or imagery for use in merchandise  entertainment (movies  music  artwork  etc) or advertisement  including tonight's @Dodge #SuperBowl commercial.""
The ad begins with the words ""Dr. Martin Luther King Jr."" and gives the date Feb.     day  years ago to the day after when King gave his sermon.

3698,dev,"In September of    Gerardo Serrano  was driving from  his  home in Kentucky to visit relatives in Mexico. When  he  stopped at the border in Texas  Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers searched  his  truck and found five bullets in the center console. While  Serrano  has a concealed carry permit   he  did not have any weapon in the vehicle.  He  had simply forgotten about the bullets  he âd left in the console.
Always eager to pounce on any excuse to grab property (which often helps pad the budget of the law enforcement agency involved)  the Border Patrol officers declared that  Serrano  was transporting âmunitions of warâ and therefore they were taking  his  vehicle from  him . Customs did not attempt to bring any criminal action against  him   but impounded  his  truck under civil asset forfeiture. Under that law  government officials can take a personâs property on the theory that the property itself is guilty of some wrongdoing.
 Serrano   however  wasnât about to let the CBP keep  his  truck  worth around $ . To fight the forfeiture   he  had to post a $  bond  and promptly did so.  He  then waited and waited for the legal process to begin. As of this August   he  was still waiting. All the while   he  had to keep making payments on  his  loan and keep the truck insured.
But once  Serrano  got help from the Institute for Justice (IJ)  the government changed its tune.

3699,dev,"The point of  Patreon  isn't how many people earn a full-time living  it's how much of the money from art goes to artists
This week's Patreon PR fumble (the company changed what kinds of support are permissible and the way fees are paid and then said it was good for creators  when it clearly wasn't) prompted people to take a closer look at  Patreon  and  its  business.
That's good news  because  Patreon  has the power to behave in pretty exploitative ways towards the artists that use the platform  so they should be scrutinized carefully so that creators understand the bargain they're making when they sign up for the service.
But some of the criticism is badly misplaced. In No one makes a living on  Patreon  on The Outline  Brent Knepper argues that because only a very small number of the users of the service earn a real  full-time living from their art  the service is a kind of shell-game that promises financial independence and delivers hobby income.
Patreon represents a kind of tinkering with the margins of the copyright system  a way to let creators bypass large swathes of the industry and collect payments directly from their audiences. It doesn't particularly help them find an audience  nor make work for that audience -- but it does mean that where there is a willingness on the part of the audience to pay for the pleasure of a work  a much larger share of the income generated by the work goes to the artist.
The right way to look at a % success rate in delivering a full-time living to creators on  Patreon  is to first compare that number to the percentage of people who  for example  send a demo to a record label and then get to quit their jobs to be full-time musicians (that's a lot less than %). The right way to look at the remaining % of  Patreon  artists who earn some money from the service is to compare how much money they get  compared to how much money they'd get if they had to rely on more indirect (and less artist-friendly) sources like ad brokers and traditional retail channels.
On both of these metrics   Patreon  is performing beautifully. On these metrics   Patreon  is a fucking godsend to artists.
Yes  they did something stupid with their payment processing this week. Yes  that exposes how dangerous it is to rely on a company for your artistic living. But  the measure of Patreon's success  isn't creating an army of full-time creators with middle-class incomes where none existed before:  it 's ensuring that the money generated by art goes primarily to artists.","[""The point of  Patreon  isn't how many people earn a full-time living  it's how much of the money from art goes to artists"", ""This week's Patreon PR fumble (the company changed what kinds of support are permissible and the way fees are paid and then said it was good for creators  when it clearly wasn't) prompted people to take a closer look at  Patreon  and  its  business."", ""That's good news  because  Patreon  has the power to behave in pretty exploitative ways towards the artists that use the platform  so they should be scrutinized carefully so that creators understand the bargain they're making when they sign up for the service."", 'But some of the criticism is badly misplaced.

âIs that truck with you guys?â I asked  Corey Lemley   an anti-fascist activist sitting in the passenger seat of my rental car. Lemley turned to look out the back window.
âMurfreesboro  we got your back!â shouted one ARA member  as  Lemley  and the troop made their way down the street. His fellow antifa roared in response  âWe got your back! We got your back!â
Iâd interviewed  Lemley  a few days earlier over the phone.  He  was the local antifa front man  in part because  he âd been organizing publicly in the Nashville area for months after white supremacists doxed  him . Weâd arranged to do a post-rally interview  this one on camera  and  Lemley  gave me the address of a safe house where I could pick  him  up to drive  him  to a HuffPost video team.
The GMC  though  was a more pressing concern. As soon as  Lemley  and another ARA member got into my car  the black pickup had appeared  right behind us  not even feigning subtlety after we doubled back on a side street.
 Lemley  reached into a backpack at  his  feet.

And we hadnât been the only ones followed.  Lemley  later learned that around six other trucks had tailed anti-fascist vehicles after the rally.  It  had been a coordinated operation.

With just five practices to get up to speed with coach Tony Granato and each other  the group chat and a website to study various systems were essential to bonding and developing camaraderie. Hockey Hall of Famer Cammi Granato told her brother such bonding was key in a short international tournament.

Group chats werenât a thing when  Granato  played at the  Olympics  though he loved the idea to go along with his planning.  Granato  and assistant Ron Rolston tried to get players digitally prepared by giving them some homework to study before getting the whiteboard out for some more hands-on teaching at Gangneung Hockey Centre.
âWeâve been able to post some video and some different things for them to read and kind of get a little head start â  Granato  said. âYou kind of feel even though we havenât been together  we still feel like weâve been able to do a lot of coaching and getting to know the players a lot better over the past month and a half.â
After a few players experienced travel delays  the U.S. will have its first practice with full attendance Saturday ahead of the tournament opener Feb.  against Slovenia.  Granato  waited for all  his  players to arrive before convening  his  first meeting to talk about late general manager Jim Johannson  who died unexpectedly last month at .  He  will be honored with  his  own locker stall and be thought of during the Olympics.
âWe addressed the fact that weâre all in this room is the person thatâs not here with us â  Granato  said. âWe got through that  and we got through the fact that thereâs plenty of ways that we will honor  him  with how we act  how we play. Weâre going to do everything we can that  he  saw in us to give us this opportunity.â
âThey all realize they have a unique opportunity and theyâre very similar in lots of different ways â  he  said.","['The U.S. was among the final teams to get on the ice together as a group  save for many playing at the pre-Olympic Deutschland Cup in November.

3702,dev,"Mary Lou McDonald  was elected the new leader of Sinn FÃ©in at a conference in Dublin on Saturday  in what represents a major shift for the left-wing Irish republican party.
In a first  the party's leadership is entirely female;  McDonald  is the only woman to have led Sinn FÃ©in  which was founded in the early . Another woman  Michelle O'Neill  was elected as vice president Saturday. Both women ran unopposed.
 McDonald  replaces Gerry Adams who announced his intention to step down late last year. The -year-old's -year-tenure partly spanned what is known as the Troubles; a period of discord and bloodshed relating to British rule in Northern Ireland. Majority-protestant unionists wanted Northern Ireland to remain with the United Kingdom  while majority-Catholic nationalists wanted it to be part of the Republic of Ireland. Both sides are blamed for the violence  which saw more than   people die and   people injured over the past three decades of the  century  says the BBC.
With no direct connection to the Troubles   -year-old McDonald  is seen as a fresh start for the party.
""We must only agree that the past is never again repeated ""  she  said in a speech Saturday  as quoted by The Associated Press. ""On other things  we can agree to disagree. The poet Maya Angelou put it well: 'History  despite its wrenching pain  cannot be unlived. But if faced with courage  need not be lived again.'  ""
In her speech Saturday   McDonald  said with the party's new leadership  it was time to bring ""innovative and modern ways of advancing our politics "" reports The Guardian.
 McDonald  said the party would campaign for abortion rights in Ireland's referendum set for later this year.
 She  also maintained Sinn FÃ©in's opposition to border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as part of a Brexit deal. While the U.K. voted to leave the European Union  the Republic of Ireland remains part of the E.U. and the question of what to do with its border to the north has been a sticking point in negotiations  as it has sparked fears of reawakening old tensions.
But The Irish Times notes  McDonald  struck a more conciliatory tone toward the E.U. than the party has used in the past.

On the face of things  todayâs announcement that Germanyâs two leading mainstream parties have agreed on conditions for a grand coalition comes as a relief. The country has been waiting six long months for a workable government to materialize  and now it finally has one. Supporters of business as usual will be thrilled.  Angela Merkel  will continue to be chancellor  and  she  will go right on running things in the same low-key  low-expectation style  her  people have come to expect.
On closer inspection  though  matters look rather different.  Merkel  emerges from the latest coalition negotiations as a dramatically diminished figure.  She  has been forced to pay an extremely high price to  her  negotiating partners in the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD)  and the rank-and-file among  her  own Christian Democrats (CDU) are unlikely to forget it anytime soon. (Thereâs also the problem that the   Social Democrats have yet to vote on the coalition agreement  and thereâs a serious chance they wonât approve it.) Gone are the days when  Merkel  could shape the German political landscape as  she  wanted. Even if  she  retains  her  seat as chancellor  the end of  her  era is already in sight.
This is only one of several areas in which Merkelâs weakened position forced her to cede ground to the Social Democrats  who gained control of the crucial finance  foreign  and labor ministries. (The editor of one leading newspaper has archly called it âthe first SPD government led by a CDU chancellor.â) The Christian Democrats managed to retain the defense ministry  whose incumbent  Ursula von der Leyen  is a possible successor to  Merkel .
So  yes   Merkel  will be the chancellor once again. But  her  partyâs disastrous performance in Septemberâs election and the lopsided terms of the coalition agreement have stirred up discontent within the CDUâs ranks  and that unhappiness is likely to make itself felt as soon as  she  begins  her  new term. Meanwhile  many Social Democrats are worried the grand coalition will end up damaging their own party most of all (just as it has in the past  when  Merkel  appropriated many of the Social Democratsâ most popular ideas).
And what about the future? Younger Germans  who have had  Merkel  around for a good portion of their lives  clearly want to see something different. In recent surveys of Germans between the ages of  and   a whopping  percent of them agreed with the sentence âpoliticians donât care what I thinkâ â a sign of deep alienation from the existing system of political parties. (It might have something to do with the fact that the age of Germanyâs average political party member is .)
As the AfD challenge shows  never has Germany been more desperately in need of new political ideas. The notion that most Germans are averse to change  and simply want to coast along in a rerun of previous coalitions  is belied by the polls. One recent survey showed that only  percent of voters approve of a fourth term for  Merkel   down from  percent six months earlier. Forty-six percent oppose a fourth term. If current trends persist  Merkelâs chancellorship is likely to taper into a long  drawn-out whimper of disillusionment.","['German Chancellor Angela Merkel  center  with Horst Seehofer  left  the chairman of the Christian Social Union  and Martin Schulz  the leader of Germanyâ\x80\x99s Social Democratic Party  in Berlin on Feb. .

 Kermit Dyke  graduated from high school in   at the peak of the Great Depression.

So  Dyke   tall  blond and handsome  joined the National Guard.
 It  drilled just once a month  but  it  gave  him  three things: a little spending money; a bit part in a Hollywood silent film (âThey needed someone to stand there in a uniform with a rifle; I got five dollarsâ); and an entry into what  he  describes as âprobably the most honorable profession there is.â
In    he  entered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point  and today  at    he  is its oldest living graduate. Sitting in the home  he  shares with  his  wife  Bobbe  in Solomons  Md.  the retired colonel cradled an old album stuffed with black-and-white photos of young men posing in jodhpurs and Shako hats  sitting on horseback  or just goofing around in T-shirts and shorts.
 Dyke  served in World War II as an Air Force officer in Africa  Italy and France. (Mary F. Calvert/For The Washington Post)
He was born two days before the start of World War I â too late to have met his grandfather   Robert Dyke . âThereâs Grandpaâs sword â  he  said  pointing up at the wall. Sliding off the leather sheath revealed a blade with delicate engravings of flowers and an image of a woman  and  at the base  crude notches whose meaning could only be guessed at: XXXIIII.
 He  was first attracted to  his  wife  a chemistry major and science teacher  because  as she explained  âIâd read all the books on  his  required-reading list.â

Looking over  his  photos   Dyke  recalled things  he  liked and didnât like about West Point.  He  liked firing guns.  He  didnât like getting up at  a.m. Or the fact that âwhen you were a plebe  you couldnât look down at the food you were eating; you had to look straight ahead. They didnât want you to feel like you were being pampered.â
But there was plenty of fun. Part of cadet training included learning to waltz and fox trot  and photos showed  Dyke  and  his  classmates dancing in a stage production alongside attractive companions with long hair  glamorous makeup and flared skirts.
âThese are all men â  he  noted â fellow students at the academy. West Point did not admit its first co-ed class until  years after he matriculated.

3713,dev,"'Promise Me':  Joe  Biden On Loss  Grief And Recovery
But this time was different for  Joe Biden .
That's how the former vice president closes Chapter  of his new book  out Tuesday  Promise Me  Dad: A Year of Hope  Hardship  and Purpose.  Biden  recounts in vivid  heart-wrenching detail what it was like for him and his family from the time  his  eldest son  Beau  a rising star in the Democratic Party  was diagnosed with brain cancer  to his death less than two years later and the aftermath.
It's hard not to feel for Biden  who exudes humanity throughout the book. He lays bare his emotions and vulnerabilities at losing a son with so much promise  which is made even more difficult by the understanding that  Biden  has faced unthinkable tragedy before. As almost anyone reading this likely knows  when he was first elected as a U.S. senator from Delaware   Biden 's young wife and daughter were killed in a car crash.  His  sons Beau and Hunter   and  at the time  were in the backseat. They survived  but were hospitalized for days.  Joe Biden  had just turned .
And now  four decades later   he  was losing Beau   his  trusted adviser.  Biden  writes that  he  was ""pretty sure"" Beau could have run for president one day.  Biden  describes Beau â who was attorney general of Delaware at the time of  his  diagnosis and set to run for governor â as like  him   but better.
""Beau Biden  at age   was  Joe Biden  . ""  Biden  writes. "" He  had all the best of me  but with the bugs and flaws engineered out.""
If former President Barack Obama's book was called Dreams From My Father   Biden 's could have been Dreams Of My Son.
 Biden  weaves in his responsibilities as the right-hand man to the most powerful person in the world  then-President Obama  which included a hefty foreign-policy portfolio. It served as a powerful device in understanding just how much  Biden  was juggling  even if some of the detail about Ukrainian and Russian troop movements felt extraneous at times.
 Biden  was taking calls on secure lines in hospital rooms next to  his  son's while attempting to understand what was happening to Beau â and trying to keep it all private.
The possibility of running for president is a constant thread throughout the book and ties it together.  Biden  was considering it far more seriously than previously reported  and  he  had begun planning a run in the summer of    he  writes.
Electoral politics is never far behind in Promise Me. The last chapter of the book  in which  he  reveals why  he  didn't run  is even titled  ""Run  Joe  Run.""  He  takes the reader inside the deliberations  right up to the point of  his  -hour decision not to run â something that went against Beau's wishes.
 Biden  was actually all set to run. By October    Biden  was even editing  his  announcement speech. It laid out a vision that was different from the grievance politics presented by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders â and more hopeful than the technocratic plans laid out by Hillary Clinton.
 He  had also assembled a team that was not just made up of  his  inner circle. It included some top Obama staffers  like communications adviser Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer  one of the top Democratic elections lawyers in the country.  He  had Obama's Ohio field director  a top South Carolina adviser and a list of people ready to endorse.
Five months after Beau's death  and with Clinton struggling to get past her email server controversy   Biden  had some good will â and political momentum.
But  he  decided against it.  He  knew in  his  heart  he  wasn't ready.
There was the time earlier in the summer  for example  on the tarmac in Colorado  where  he  was set to speak at a pair of Democratic fundraisers  when someone called out that they had served with Beau.","[""'Promise Me':  Joe  Biden On Loss  Grief And Recovery"", 'But this time was different for  Joe Biden .', ""That's how the former vice president closes Chapter  of his new book  out Tuesday  Promise Me  Dad: A Year of Hope  Hardship  and Purpose.

3717,dev,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co executive John Lasseter  who heads animation at both Disney and Pixar   told company staff on Tuesday  he  was taking a six-month leave of absence following what  he  called âmisstepsâ including unwanted hugs that made employees uncomfortable  according to a memo seen by Reuters.

âItâs never easy to face your missteps  but itâs the only way to learn from them â  Lasseter  said in the memo  in which  he  apologized to employees who felt âdisrespected or uncomfortable.â
âI especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way  shape  or form â  he  added. âNo matter how benign my intent  everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.â
A pioneer in computer animation   Lasseter  has been the driving creative force behind Disneyâs success in animated films over the past decade.  He  is an Oscar winner and chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios.
Disney said in a statement that it appreciated  Lasseter âs âcandor and sincere apologyâ and supported  his  leave of absence.
 Lasseter  is the latest Hollywood figure to be accused of inappropriate behavior toward women since producer Harvey Weinstein was fired from his company in October after allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Weinstein has denied allegations of non-consensual sex.
News of Lasseterâs decision to take a leave of absence was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter. The industry publication also published a story on Tuesday that said some women at Disney had been made uncomfortable by physical contact initiated by  Lasseter .
Disney did not respond to a request for comment on allegations reported by The Hollywood Reporter.  Lasseter  did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment.
 Lasseter     joined the company in  when Disney bought Pixar Animation Studios and named  him  chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios.  He  has produced a number of commercially successful films and been praised as a modern-day Walt Disney.
Part of Pixarâs founding team in    Lasseter  has overseen  movies that have won the Academy Award for best animated feature  including âUp â âFinding Nemoâ and âFrozen.â
Disney animation and Pixar films have sold roughly $ billion worth of tickets worldwide since  Lasseter  joined Disney  according to a Reuters analysis of data from the Box Office Mojo website.
 Lasseter  directed the  hit âToy Story â the first feature-length computer-animated film  which earned  him  an Oscar for special achievement  and has been credited with leading a resurgence of Disney Animation. The studio was revitalized with the  musical âFrozenâ and  Oscar winner âZootopia.â

Angela Merkel  leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)  arrives at the German Parliamentary Society offices before the start of exploratory talks about forming a new coalition government in Berlin  Germany November   . REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke
With her former coalition partners  the Social Democrats (SPD)  determined to go into opposition   Merkel  is pushing for a coalition with the ecologist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP)  after her conservatives bled support to the far-right in an election last month.
âI think difficult deliberations lie ahead of us in the coming days â  Merkel  told reporters on arrival for a fresh round of exploratory talks on Friday. âBut I still think we can tie the ends together if we try and work hard.â

3721,dev,"The Uptown honky-tonk institution  which abruptly closed in September  beneath a mountain of debt  likely will reopen during the coming months  said  Tressa Feher  chief of staff for  Ward Ald . James Cappleman.
Ed Warm  who operates another longtime Chicago bar  Joeâs on Weed Street  is expected to take over the lease and licenses for Carolâs Pub after more than a year of negotiations   Feher  said.
It wasnât always certain that Carolâs would reopen  but doing so was important to the aldermanâs office   Feher  said.
âWe had many residents contact us when it closed â  Feher  said. âThey were upset and saying that it was one of the reasons they moved to the area â which surprised me a little bit.â
However   she  acknowledged that the bar became more than a bar; it was a neighborhood landmark.
âWhenever Iâd talk about where I live â because I live not far from there â people say  âOh  you live near Carolâs ââ  she  said. âEveryone knows where it is  and itâs an important part of the history in Uptown.â
 She  said Warm is likely to run Carolâs similar to what it was: âThe goal is to have it pretty much the same  with a little cleaning  a few improvements on the inside and increased security.â
Carolâs will maintain its  a.m. license ( a.m. on weekends)  but it will open significantly later than it once did â at  p.m. during the week. The aldermanâs office supports the change   Feher  said.
âWe didnât have a lot of  calls there before  but there were some folks who started drinking as soon as they opened â noon or earlier â and they would maybe be a little intoxicated outside of the business  talking and other things that would create some issues with the neighborhood â  Feher  said.","['The Uptown honky-tonk institution  which abruptly closed in September  beneath a mountain of debt  likely will reopen during the coming months  said  Tressa Feher  chief of staff for  Ward Ald .

3725,dev,"Bill Gates  Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have a combined net worth of approximately $ billion. Together  they  have amassed more money than the GDPs of Greece  Hungary  or Algeria. While each entrepreneur has a unique set of traits that has made him successful  these three tech founders also have a few things in common that have allowed them to build some of the world's most respected and innovative organizations. View As: One Page Slides
. Impeccable pattern recognition. In   Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard after just two years. He reportedly spent more time using computers in the computer lab than studying for exams. Gates  along with his co-founder Paul Allen  realized that the personal computer was going to need software to run it successfully. After purchasing an Altair  (an early home computer)  he and Allen projected that a computer would eventually make it into every home in the United States. In   Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard sent an email to Elon Musk  who had already successfully participated in PayPal and founded SpaceX  asking for an interview to discuss an investment in his new electric car company. Musk  who had believed in the power of electric cars for a decade  was keen to invest. Musk's involvement generated a $. million round of funding. Eventually Musk would go on to become the chairman and CEO of Tesla.  Jeff Bezos  founded Amazon in . At the time Amazon only sold books  though  Bezos  knew from the moment  he  founded the company that the ecommerce platform should become an ""everything store."" When Amazon was founded  eBay did not exist  and Barnes and Noble was not yet selling books online.  Bezos  had a premonition about the future  and acted quickly to establish what is now a nearly $ billion company.
. Faith in themselves and in their founding teams. Gates  Bezos and Musk all had profound belief in their own capabilities and those of the founding members of their teams. It is one thing to have a visionary idea; it is another thing to drop out of Harvard  invest millions in a small electric car company or risk insurmountable debt.  Take Jeff Bezos  as an example. After graduating from Princeton   he  eventually ended up as a senior vice president of DE Shaw  an investment company. When  he  hatched the idea of an online bookstore   he  left  his  job at DE Shaw in the middle of . In other words   Bezos  walked away from a considerable end-of-year bonus in favor of founding a small company headquartered in  his  garage.
. High risk tolerance. Founding a startup entails a great deal of risk. One study found that after  years of being in business  % of startups fail. This means that  statistically speaking  Gates  Musk and  Bezos  were facing tough odds when they decided to leave otherwise comfortable lives to start a risky business venture. For example  Musk left  his  PhD program at Stanford University to found a company called  with  his  brother. The company was sold to Compaq  netting Musk a bit over $ million. But rather than pocket the cash and ride off into the sunset  Musk once again took a great risk by investing millions of dollars to found a company called X.com  which would later merge with another company to form PayPal.
. Preference for horizontal or vertical integration. Microsoft  Amazon  Tesla and SpaceX are all organizations that tend to prefer vertically integrated products. A critical component of Microsoft's development was the horizontal integration with other software platforms through acquisition.

Together  they  have amassed more money than the GDPs of Greece  Hungary  or Algeria. While each entrepreneur has a unique set of traits that has made him successful  these three tech founders also have a few things in common that have allowed them to build some of the world's most respected and innovative organizations. View As: One Page Slides"", '. Impeccable pattern recognition. In   Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard after just two years. He reportedly spent more time using computers in the computer lab than studying for exams. Gates  along with his co-founder Paul Allen  realized that the personal computer was going to need software to run it successfully. After purchasing an Altair  (an early home computer)  he and Allen projected that a computer would eventually make it into every home in the United States. In   Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard sent an email to Elon Musk  who had already successfully participated in PayPal and founded SpaceX  asking for an interview to discuss an investment in his new electric car company. Musk  who had believed in the power of electric cars for a decade  was keen to invest. Musk\'s involvement generated a $. million round of funding. Eventually Musk would go on to become the chairman and CEO of Tesla.  Jeff Bezos  founded Amazon in . At the time Amazon only sold books  though  Bezos  knew from the moment  he  founded the company that the ecommerce platform should become an ""everything store."" When Amazon was founded  eBay did not exist  and Barnes and Noble was not yet selling books online.  Bezos  had a premonition about the future  and acted quickly to establish what is now a nearly $ billion company.', '. Faith in themselves and in their founding teams. Gates  Bezos and Musk all had profound belief in their own capabilities and those of the founding members of their teams. It is one thing to have a visionary idea; it is another thing to drop out of Harvard  invest millions in a small electric car company or risk insurmountable debt.  Take Jeff Bezos  as an example. After graduating from Princeton   he  eventually ended up as a senior vice president of DE Shaw  an investment company. When  he  hatched the idea of an online bookstore   he  left  his  job at DE Shaw in the middle of . In other words   Bezos  walked away from a considerable end-of-year bonus in favor of founding a small company headquartered in  his  garage.', '. High risk tolerance. Founding a startup entails a great deal of risk. One study found that after  years of being in business  % of startups fail. This means that  statistically speaking  Gates  Musk and  Bezos  were facing tough odds when they decided to leave otherwise comfortable lives to start a risky business venture. For example  Musk left  his  PhD program at Stanford University to found a company called  with  his  brother. The company was sold to Compaq  netting Musk a bit over $ million. But rather than pocket the cash and ride off into the sunset  Musk once again took a great risk by investing millions of dollars to found a company called X.com  which would later merge with another company to form PayPal.', "". Preference for horizontal or vertical integration. Microsoft  Amazon  Tesla and SpaceX are all organizations that tend to prefer vertically integrated products. A critical component of Microsoft's development was the horizontal integration with other software platforms through acquisition. For example  in   the company acquired SOFTIMAGE  and a year later it acquired Altamira. Amazon  Tesla and SpaceX all embrace vertical integration. Amazon is already developing their own brand of products called Amazon Basics  and is working on delivery systems as well. This means that    in the near future  Amazon will produce  retail and distribute  their  products  owning the production chain from start to finish.

3726,dev,"One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. She had put it aside  one cent and then another and then another  in her careful buying of meat and other food.  Della  counted it three times. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. There was nothing to do but fall on the bed and cry. So  Della  did it.
Thatâs how the story of  Della  and  Jim  begins. Della fretting over buying the perfect Christmas gift for âher  Jim .â
âShe had had many happy hours planning something nice for  him . Something nearly good enough.
Something almost worth the honor of belonging to  Jim .â
The first thing that shines through this extraordinary little tale is the love  Della  has for  her Jim . When she finally cries her way into figuring out how to make a little extra money and discovers the perfect gift â a pocketwatch chain for  Jim âs only thing of value  an inherited gold watch â thereâs not a sentence in literature that expresses more profound affection:
It was a gold watch chain  very simply made. Its value was in its rich and pure material. Because it was so plain and simple  you knew that it was very valuable. All good things are like this. It was good enough for The Watch. As soon as she saw it  she knew that  Jim  must have it. It was like  him . Quietness and valueâJim and the chain both had quietness and value. She paid twenty-one dollars for it. And she hurried home with the chain and eighty-seven cents.
I wonât give away the ending (seriously  read it)  but letâs just say O. Henry is known for delivering a twist ending that makes M. Night Shyamalan look like a film school novice. And what  Della  and  her  husband discover in their mutual search for the perfect gift is the beauty of sacrifice for the beloved. And if that isnât the story of God sacrificing his only son to the sin and violence of mankind because he so loved the world  I donât know what is.
The sacrament of marriage is supposed to mirror the connection that God has to his church.  Della  and Jim embody that connection  selflessly giving up the things they value to show their love for each other  and being content in the discovery that those sacrifices donât always yield quite what one expects. But often the act of sacrifice is enough. O. Henry compares his charactersâ sacrifice for each other to the gifts of the Magi (the Wise Men)  brought from far-away lands to honor the birth of the baby Jesus. Because in the selfless act of love  even when it goes hand in hand with the mistakes  Della  and  Jim  make  there is wisdom. Maybe infinite and ineffable wisdom.
I never thought of Christmas the same way again after that reading. I had to go back and re-read that story many times over the years; something always compelled me to do so  and that something was planted during the  minutes I spent sitting with my father  listening to him gently tell the tale of  Della  and  her Jim .

3729,dev,"BERLIN  (Reuters) - Angela Merkel  on Sunday defended âpainfulâ concessions  she  has made to the Social Democrats (SPD) to win a fourth term as German chancellor and said criticism among  her  conservatives was not a sign  her  authority was waning.
Asked whether  she  was planning to groom a successor to lead  her  conservatives in the next election   Merkel  said  she  wanted a younger generation of  her  Christian Democrats (CDU) to fill ministerial posts in a renewed coalition with the SPD.
In an interview with the ZDF public broadcaster   she  commented on the rising displeasure among conservatives over  her  decision to give the SPD the powerful finance ministry.
âI understand the disappointment â said  Merkel   who has led Germany for the last  years.
âAnd now we need to show that we can start with a new team â  she  added. âWe have six ministerial posts to fill and from my point of view we need to ensure that not only the over- are considered but also younger people.â
 Merkel  was weakened in a September election that saw  her  conservative bloc bleed support to a far-right party thrust into parliament for the first time by voters angry at  her  decision in  to welcome more than a million immigrants.
In November   her  efforts to form a government with two smaller parties failed  leaving the country in political deadlock and prompting some members of  her  CDU party to demand a succession plan.
Last week   she  secured a deal with the SPD to renew a right-left alliance that has ruled Germany since  after making painful concessions on Europe and fiscal policy as well as ceding the finance ministry.
 Merkel  said that if they rejected the deal  Germany would probably hold a new election.
 She  rejected a suggestion that generous concessions to the SPD had weakened  her  position in the CDU  saying  she  had decided to cut a deal for the sake of Germany.
 She  sought to allay fears among conservatives that by ceding the finance ministry  the next government will stray from the strict fiscal discipline enforced by former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.

3730,dev,"Former Vice President Joe Biden  is tiptoeing toward a potential presidential run in   even broaching the possibility during a recent gathering of longtime foreign policy aides.
Huddled in  his  newly opened office steps from the U.S. Capitol   Biden  began a planning meeting for  his  new diplomacy center by addressing the elephant in the room.  He  said  he  was keeping  his   options open  considering it a real possibility.  He  insisted  he  had made no decision  and didn't need to yet  according to five people who either attended the meeting or were briefed on it by those who did.
 Biden  also expressed interest in bringing those in the room onto  his  team if  he  decides to launch a campaign. At the same time   he  gave them an out: There would be no hard feelings if they decided they were content in their current roles outside of government  said the people  who demanded anonymity to discuss a private meeting.
The political world has long tried to game out  Biden 's plans for . After all   he  came close to running last time only to see President Donald Trump pull off a victory that many Democrats openly suggest wouldn't have happened had  he   not Hillary Clinton  been their nominee. Several people came away from the meeting with the impression that if no strong Democratic candidate emerges in the next year or so   Biden  would feel strongly compelled to run.
A presidential candidate twice before   Biden  would be  on Inauguration Day if elected in   a concerning prospect for some Democrats even though  he 's only a few years older than Trump. One possibility that  Biden 's longtime advisers have discussed privately is that  he  could announce  his  intention to serve only one term  clearing the path for  his  running mate to take over in  and potentially setting up Democrats for a -year White House stretch.
 Biden 's brief discussion about  his   deliberations came as  he  brought foreign policy staffers together to set the  agenda for the newly opened Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement â where many of them are now working  including Colin Kahl  his vice presidential national security adviser  and Steve Ricchetti  his former chief of staff. Eli Ratner  his former deputy national security adviser  and Mike Carpenter  the former Pentagon and State Department official who's now the center's senior director  also attended  as did Julianne Smith  a  Biden  adviser in the Obama administration's first term who now works at the Center for a New American Security  a Washington think tank.
A  Biden  spokesman declined to comment. But in a recent NBC News interview   Biden  said  he 'd decide on running in  based on whether it was ""the right thing to do.""
""I'm focused on one thing: electing a Democratic Congress to stop this erosion of the core of who we are  "" Biden  said. ""I'll look at that a year from now. I have plenty of time to consider whether or not to run.""
The meeting was one of several signs that  Biden  is beginning to position  himself  as an alternative to Trump.  Biden  has started denouncing the current president's leadership more frequently in public  as  he  crisscrosses the United States and beyond to promote  his  new book   his  cancer initiative   his  new domestic policy institute in Delaware  the diplomacy center and  his  new political action committee  American Possibilities.
 He 's also been gearing up to play a major role campaigning for Democrats seeking to retake the House and Senate in the  midterms.
""Donald Trump's looking out for Donald Trump. Republicans are looking out for Donald Trump. Who's looking out for everyone else?  Democrats "" Biden  wrote in a recent fundraising pitch to the PAC's supporters.  He  said in    he  would ""beat a path all across this country to stand up for leaders who will stand up for all of us.""
In    Biden 's face was plastered across cable news channels and newspaper front pages for months as  he  carried out a lengthy deliberation about whether to challenge Clinton for the nomination. Ultimately   he  decided  he  and  his  family weren't in position to run so soon after  his  son  former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden  died from brain cancer earlier that year. Yet many Democrats have argued that  his  ""everyman"" brand and blue-collar appeal would make  him  particularly well-suited to challenge Trump.","['Former Vice President Joe Biden  is tiptoeing toward a potential presidential run in   even broaching the possibility during a recent gathering of longtime foreign policy aides.', ""Huddled in  his  newly opened office steps from the U.S. Capitol   Biden  began a planning meeting for  his  new diplomacy center by addressing the elephant in the room.

3731,dev,"Jeffrey Reifman     a tech entrepreneur who splits  his  time between Washington state and Oregon  has had ACA insurance for four years  and it has covered surgery to remove a benign but potentially dangerous brain tumor and the follow-up treatment. For the third time   he  must find a different health plan because  his  insurer is pulling out of the marketplace.  He  browsed HealthCare.gov until  he  discovered one in Oregon with  his  neurosurgeon and endocrinologist in its network.
But on Saturday  when  he  tried to have the website âproofâ  his  identity so  he  could select the PacificSource plan   he  got a message saying it could not be verified.  He  was told to call the credit-rating agency Experian  with which the government contracts for that part of the process  and share a code. The computer screen did not provide a code  though.
 Reifman  suspects the problem might be that  he  had frozen  his  credit after a nationwide Equifax hack in September.

3732,dev,"A police department in the Lansing  Michigan  area missed an opportunity to pursue criminal charges in  against  Larry Nassar  and will publicly apologize to the victim who accused the doctor of molesting  her  during treatment for an abnormal spine  an official said Wednesday.
 Nassar  who was a sports doctor at Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics   convinced police that  he  had performed a legitimate procedure with  his  hands and even provided a PowerPoint presentation to explain. The case was dropped  effectively allowing  him  to continue to molest girls and young women  including Olympians  for years until  his  arrest in . A total of  women and girls have said they were assaulted.
The township released the  police report on Randall-Gay's allegations against  Nassar . Walsh said the township was told to withhold it from the public until  Nassar  was sentenced last week to  to  years in prison for sexually assaulting young women and girls in Ingham County. Another sentencing is underway this week in a similar case in Eaton County.
In   Randall-Gay was  when she and her mother visited  Nassar  to discuss treatment for scoliosis  a curvature of the spine.  He  sent her to physical therapy but saw her again  this time alone.
Randall-Gay had a back problem. But she told police that  Nassar  had removed her underwear  forcibly cupped her genitals with  his  hand and rubbed her breasts â all without gloves.
 Nassar  told police  he  applied pressure to the ""perineum "" using a formal word for an area between the legs  and said it was done to manipulate a ligament  according to the report.
 Nassar  provided a paper version of a PowerPoint presentation about the ligament procedure  titled ""The Grand Junction."" There's no indication that police shared his technical explanation with an outside expert. The case was closed.
Walsh said questions about the investigation will be answered during a news conference Thursday with the police chief and Randall-Gay  who now lives in Washington state. Meridian Township paid for her to travel to Michigan to testify at  Nassar 's sentencing last week.
Back in    Nassar  ""had the audacity to tell (police) I misunderstood the treatment because I was not comfortable with my body "" Randall-Gay said.

3735,dev,"Update  Nov. : Michael Oreskes resigned from NPR on Wednesday.
The women  both journalists at the time of the alleged incidents  made the accusations in recent weeks against  Michael Oreskes   senior vice president of news and editorial director at the Washington-based public broadcasting organization.
In separate complaints  the women said Oreskes â at the time  the Washington bureau chief of the New York Times â abruptly kissed them while they were speaking with him about working at the newspaper. Both of them told similar stories: After meeting  Oreskes  and discussing their job prospects  they said he unexpectedly kissed them on the lips and stuck his tongue in their mouths.
The alleged incidents occurred in the late   the women said.  Oreskes  joined NPR in March  after working at the Times and the Associated Press in senior editing roles.
 Oreskes  didnât respond to multiple requests for comment.
Both complainants say  Oreskesâs  alleged behavior had a lasting impact.

The women said they met with  Oreskes  after  he  expressed an interest in reviewing their work and giving them career advice  possibly with an eye toward hiring them as reporters. Neither was ever hired.
The first woman said she met  Oreskes  at the Timesâ offices in the Army and Navy Club Building in downtown Washington.
Thereafter  she said   Oreskes  invited her to have lunch in a room at the Watergate Hotel  catered by room service. She declined the offer.
âThe worst part of my whole encounter with  Oreskes  wasnât the weird offers of room service lunch or the tongue kiss but the fact that he utterly destroyed my ambition â she said.
The second woman recounted a similar sequence of events. After booking him on a TV program that she was producing  and mentioning that she wanted to return to print reporting  he offered to review her published work. They agreed to meet at a local restaurant  but at the last minute   Oreskes  called and said he had a trip planned that day and was running late. He asked to meet at her apartment. She agreed.
The apartment meeting went off without issue  although the woman recalled feeling uncomfortable when  Oreskes  placed his hand in the small of her back as she showed him around her apartment. She then offered to drive him to Reagan National Airport for his flight. As she pulled to the curb   Oreskes  said goodbye  then kissed her unexpectedly  she said.
Later  she said  she got a voice-mail message from  Oreskes  saying how much he enjoyed meeting her and that he looked forward to seeing her again.
Two people who worked at the Times with  Oreskes  around the late  recalled that he focused extraordinary attention on another young woman who worked as a news aide in the Washington bureau.
This account was confirmed by Jill Abramson  who was  Oreskes âs deputy at the time. Abramson  who went on to become the Timesâ top editor and is now a columnist and a senior lecturer at Harvard  said in an interview that she regretted not confronting  Oreskes  about  his  behavior.","['Update  Nov. : Michael Oreskes resigned from NPR on Wednesday.', 'The women  both journalists at the time of the alleged incidents  made the accusations in recent weeks against  Michael Oreskes   senior vice president of news and editorial director at the Washington-based public broadcasting organization.', 'In separate complaints  the women said Oreskes â\x80\x94 at the time  the Washington bureau chief of the New York Times â\x80\x94 abruptly kissed them while they were speaking with him about working at the newspaper.

Ukrainian security services arrested  Saakashvili  on Saturday following a botched attempt several days earlier when supporters swarmed the van where  he  was being held.
On Saturday  he  said  he  was going on hunger strike in protest at  his  detention.
 He  is also wanted in  his  native Georgia for alleged abuse of power.
 He  spearheaded a pro-Western âRose Revolutionâ in Georgia in  and fought a disastrous war with Russia five years later that eventually prompted  him  to flee the Caucasus country.
 Saakashvili  returned to the spotlight as a vocal champion of the three-month street uprising in Kiev that toppled a Moscow-backed government in  and turned Ukraine on a pro-EU course.
Poroshenko rewarded  Saakashvili  for his efforts by appointing  him  governor of the important Black Sea region of Odessa in  before the two men fell out.","['Kiev (AFP) â\x80\x93 Thousands of people rallied Sunday in central Kiev to demand the release of detained former Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili and the impeachment of his rival  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.', ' Saakashvili  was president of Georgia from  to  but acquired Ukrainian nationality and served as a governor in Ukraine before falling out with Poroshenko.', 'Ukrainian security services arrested  Saakashvili  on Saturday following a botched attempt several days earlier when supporters swarmed the van where  he  was being held.', 'On Saturday  he  said  he  was going on hunger strike in protest at  his  detention.', ' He  is also wanted in  his  native Georgia for alleged abuse of power.', ' He  spearheaded a pro-Western â\x80\x9cRose Revolutionâ\x80\x9d in Georgia in  and fought a disastrous war with Russia five years later that eventually prompted  him  to flee the Caucasus country.', ' Saakashvili  returned to the spotlight as a vocal champion of the three-month street uprising in Kiev that toppled a Moscow-backed government in  and turned Ukraine on a pro-EU course.', 'Poroshenko rewarded  Saakashvili  for his efforts by appointing  him  governor of the important Black Sea region of Odessa in  before the two men fell out.']","['Kiev (AFP) â\x80\x93 Thousands of people rallied Sunday in central Kiev to demand the release of detained former Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili and the impeachment of his rival  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko', 'Saakashvili  was president of Georgia from  to  but acquired Ukrainian nationality and served as a governor in Ukraine before falling out with Poroshenko', 'Ukrainian security services arrested  Saakashvili  on Saturday following a botched attempt several days earlier when supporters swarmed the van where  he  was being held', 'On Saturday  he  said  he  was going on hunger strike in protest at  his  detention', 'He  is also wanted in  his  native Georgia for alleged abuse of power', 'He  spearheaded a pro-Western â\x80\x9cRose Revolutionâ\x80\x9d in Georgia in  and fought a disastrous war with Russia five years later that eventually prompted  him  to flee the Caucasus country', 'Saakashvili  returned to the spotlight as a vocal champion of the three-month street uprising in Kiev that toppled a Moscow-backed government in  and turned Ukraine on a pro-EU course', 'Poroshenko rewarded  Saakashvili  for his efforts by appointing  him  governor of the important Black Sea region of Odessa in  before the two men fell out']",Mikheil Saakashvili,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,3

 Serena Williams  announced Thursday that  she  will not be playing in next weekâs Australian Open  saying  she  didnât want to compete in a tournament  she  felt  she  couldnât get all the way through to a championship. Last week  the -year-old played in  her  first competitive match since giving birth to  her  daughter  Alexis Olympia  on Sept. .
Of that exhibition match  which  she  lost to French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko   Williams  said in a statement posted on Snapchat  âAfter competing in Abu Dhabi I realized that although I am super close  Iâm not where I personally want to be.â
âMy coach and team always said âonly go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the wayâ. I can compete â but I donât want to just compete  I want to do far better than that and to do so  I will need a little more time â  Williams  continued. âWith that being said  and even though I am disappointed about it  Iâve decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year.
After winning last year in Melbourne  defeating her sister Venus for her  Grand Slam singles title   Williams  revealed that  she  had competed at the tournament only a couple of days following the discovery that  she  was approximately eight weeks pregnant. Saying in April that  she  had been ânervousâ about playing in such a condition   Williams  added  âI really felt that I didnât have time to deal with any extra emotions  any extra anything  because  pregnant or not  no one knew  and I was supposed to win that tournament as I am every tournament that I show up .

âPeople were fleeing  they were panicking â  he  said. âThe gunfire was sporadic. It would stop and then more shots  then a lull and then more shots. I could hear people yelling at them to shut off the lights  to be quiet.
For a while   Becker  didnât even know the popping sounds were gunfire.  He  thought at first they were firecrackers or bad speakers at the Jason Aldean concert.
âThen I started looking at my photographs  and what I was seeing was just unbelievable â  he  said. âIt had been so dark outside I couldnât see the details. I just saw a lot of people laying on the ground thinking they were playing possum  but now I could see people covered in blood and I thought  âThis is real.â When I saw the image of the woman lying on the ground covered in blood  that was when the impact of what I was experiencing hit â when I realized people were dying.â
A man lays on top of a woman  shielding her from gunfire as others flee the festival grounds.  Becker  reported that they later got up and ran away.
People run from the festival grounds. âOnce the crowd started to flee I went outside and saw a lot of people panicking and running for the exit that was right by the media tent â  Becker  said. âI grabbed my camera and went back outside and found a place where I could see what was happening and also wouldnât be in the way of people  so I stood on a table and started to shoot â thinking to  myself  still that this isnât really happening  itâs just the speakers popping.â
People are seen on the ground after the gunman opened fire. âIt was so dark I couldnât really see what was happening â  Becker  said. âThere were a lot of people crying  speaking on cell phones and ducking for cover. As the crowd thinned out  I was able to go a little closer to try and see what was going on and take some more pictures.â
Concertgoers help an injured person at the scene. âIâve been doing this work for many years  and it is instinct to photograph first and ask questions later â  Becker  said. âIt probably seems irrational to just walk out and take pictures of people running for cover  but that is second nature for a photojournalist.â

3749,dev,"But the keto diet is not for everyone  so I sought medical supervision.  Dr. Priyanka Wali  is an internal-medicine physician with specialty training in obesity medicine.  She  uses the keto diet routinely for  her  patients who have insulin resistance  pre-diabetes  and diabetes. In    Wali  was moonlighting at a weight-loss clinic in San Francisco  where  she  saw  her  patients struggle to stick to their strict diet programs and maintain their weight loss.  She  started reading studies on low-carb diets and became convinced it was the solution.  Wali  made  herself  a guinea pig before  she  prescribed the diet. And it worked.  She  said  she  ""expected to feel a lot of adverse side effects"" from eating so much fat  ""but what ended up happening was I felt great. I started to have more energy and concentration. I didn't lose weight  but my fat distribution changed  so I lost weight from my hips.""
After asking me about my family history and my reasons for trying the keto diet   Wali  determined I was an ""optimizer "" like the healthy tech workers who rely on the diet. Tech workers living in the Bay Area sometimes go to extreme lengths to improve their bodies and minds. For example  at the supplements startup HVMN (formerly known as Nootrobox)  most employees don't eat on Tuesdays â a ritual they say improves ketone production and productivity. Intermittent fasting has been shown to assist ketosis. To see if I was a good fit for the keto diet   Wali  requested I have some lab work done  including a cholesterol panel and a fasting insulin level test. My results came back normal  which meant there was no medical necessity for me to go on the diet. If I were pre-diabetic or insulin-resistant   Wali  would have been more likely to make the keto diet part of my treatment.
 Wali  introduced me to the ""keto food pyramid "" via this image that went viral on Reddit. We agreed that for my first week on the keto diet  I would aim for  to  grams of carbs during the day and eat regular  carb-heavy dinners  even if they took me over the limit. ""Sugar addiction is a real thing  "" Wali  warned me in our first meeting.  She  wanted me to ease into ketosis to avoid ""carbohydrate withdrawal "" which can cause irritability  depression  headaches  lethargy  and nausea. I was happy to take it slow. As I was learning the carb loads of different foods in those first few weeks  I tracked my meals on the Fitbit and Weight Watchers apps  but  Wali  says paper and pen works just as well.
 She  taught me how to count carbs the smart way: Carbohydrates - dietary fiber = net carbs. Fiber is a carbohydrate that the body can't digest. It doesn't raise blood-sugar levels  so there's no use in counting grams of dietary fiber toward a daily carbohydrate goal. A cup of almonds has approximately  grams of carbohydrates  but  of those come from dietary fiber. As a result  I had to count only  grams for the serving. What a bargain!
When I got home from my visit with  Wali   I was forced to rethink all my dietary staples. I let my boyfriend finish off our supply of apples  bananas  bread  pasta  rice  and potatoes.
Our office has the best snacks â Goldfish  Nature Valley bars  animal crackers  and peanut-butter-filled pretzels (my personal brand of indulgence). I thought of them often. I used to snack every hour between  a.m. and dinner. Food was always on my mind. In my first week  I dug up the willpower to resist those sugar binges. But it was not without consequences. My headaches pounded for hours on end. My mind said  ""Eat something.""  Wali  recommended I drink more water and salt my food to ease the headaches.
During Week   my ketone testing meter kit arrived in the mail. The pocket-sized medical device uses a small blood sample to measure the presence of ketones.

Keto adherents use ketone testing meters to check that they're in a state of nutritional ketosis  which is generally considered above . millimoles per liter of blood  according to  Wali . Entrepreneurs sometimes share their ketone levels on social media. It's the biohacking community's equivalent of posting photos of a bathroom scale to celebrate recent weight loss.
When I splurged on a bagel or pizza  which did happen  I wanted to curl up under my desk and nap within  minutes of eating. I felt uncomfortably full and groggy. The worst part of cheating was that it had the potential to reverse a state of nutritional ketosis. When my parents came into town over one weekend and I went rogue  I wound up with a ketone reading of . mmol/L  which meant my body was burning more carbs than fat. I returned to the diet on Monday  but it takes an average of five days for the body to use up the leftover glycogen reserves and return to nutritional ketosis  according to  Wali .
After eating mostly fat  protein  and leafy vegetables for one month  I reached my peak ketone reading of . mmol/L â a strong indication that I reached a state of ketosis. By this point in my journey  most of the negative side effects had subsided. (I experienced leg cramps and tingling sensations in my feet  which  Wali  explained was from eating too little salt.  She  suggested I try magnesium supplements  and the problem went away within days.) A ketone reading of . mmol/L indicates a mild state of ketosis.

3751,dev,"The voluntary poll is non-binding but  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull  immediately said  he  would fulfill a pledge to raise a bill in parliament with the aim of passing laws by Christmas.
 Turnbull  played down concerns of a split in  his  coalition government over the policy as the conservative faction presses for amendments to protect religious freedoms that discriminate against same-sex couples.
âIt is unequivocal  it is overwhelming. They have spoken in their millions and they have voted overwhelmingly yes for marriage equality â  Turnbull  told reporters in Canberra after the survey results were announced. âThey voted yes for fairness  yes for commitment  yes for love.â
Irish-born Qantas Airways Chief Executive Alan Joyce  one of the few openly gay business leaders in Australia  told the Sydney crowd  many of whom sheltered from the hot sun under rainbow umbrellas  that the result was âan amazing outcomeâ and urged  Turnbull  to move quickly on legislation.
 Turnbull   under pressure amid a citizenship crisis that has cost him his deputy and the governmentâs majority in parliament  finds his leadership tested again as the marriage equality bill enters parliament  possibly as early as later on Wednesday.
But political analysts said the resounding âyesâ vote presented  Turnbull  with  his  first opportunity in months to exert decisive control. At least one of the conservative lawmakers has announced plans to switch to supporting the legislation  given the strength of the public vote.","['The voluntary poll is non-binding but  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull  immediately said  he  would fulfill a pledge to raise a bill in parliament with the aim of passing laws by Christmas.', ' Turnbull  played down concerns of a split in  his  coalition government over the policy as the conservative faction presses for amendments to protect religious freedoms that discriminate against same-sex couples.', 'â\x80\x9cIt is unequivocal  it is overwhelming.

DETROIT (AP)  â Greg Kampe  is in  his   season as Oakland University's coach  and  he 's closing in on  victories.  He  was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame this year  an acknowledgement of the job  he 's done turning the suburban Detroit school into a reputable Division I basketball outpost.
Now   Kampe  feels the Golden Grizzlies need to take another big step â one that's eluded them year after year.
Oakland is - against Michigan State after an - loss to the second-ranked Spartans last weekend  and after the game   Kampe  was blunt in saying how upset  he  was that  his  team couldn't pull off the upset. Oakland has built a solid mid-major program that can compete with big-name schools  but without a signature accomplishment â like an NCAA Tournament run or a win over a team like Michigan State â it's hard to get noticed.
""It's time for this program to win that game  "" Kampe  said. ""We win them  but we beat Clemson and we beat Georgia and we beat teams like that  and nobody cares. This is a game that people would have cared.""
Oakland has come close against the Spartans  losing in overtime in   by four in   by one in  and by four in . This season   Kampe  thinks  he  has a lottery-worthy player in Kendrick Nunn  but the Spartans were still too talented and too resourceful.
""We're - against the pillar of college basketball â the blue blood ""  Kampe  said. ""We've got to beat 'em  and then we can legitimize who we are because we're a story nobody wants to tell.""
 Kampe  at least has a willing opponent in Michigan State  and Oakland has had chances to play Tom Izzo's team in reasonably neutral environments.

3754,dev,"BERLIN (AP) â German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended an election campaign that left her conservative bloc in first place but significantly weakened as she embarked Monday on what could be a lengthy quest to form a new government.
 Merkel  said the success of a nationalist  anti-migrant party that finished third in Sunday's election won't influence her foreign  European and refugee policies. She once more defended her decision to let in nearly   migrants and refugees  saying Germany wouldn't again face the humanitarian crisis that let to it.
Germany  Europe's biggest economy  has no tradition of minority governments  and  Merkel  has made clear she doesn't want to go that route. It would be a tall order anyway  as her bloc only holds  of the new parliament's  seats.
 Merkel  said Monday she will seek talks with the two parties  as well as with the Social Democrats. There's unlikely to be much movement before a state election Oct.  in Lower Saxony  one of Germany's most populous states.

 Merkel  will have to bridge differences between the Free Democrats and Greens. The parties have a tradition of mutual suspicion as well as differences on issues including environmental policy  European financial policy and the auto industry's future.
 Merkel  also faces pressure from conservative allies for an effective response to the third-place finish of the nationalist Alternative for Germany  or AfD.  The party  won entrance to parliament for the first time Sunday after a campaign that centered on harsh criticism of  Merkel  and the migrant influx.
Still  the election results left no other party or bloc besides  Merkel 's able to lead a new government  and  Merkel  herself lacks an obvious internal challenger.  She  dismissed the idea of seeking a new election.
 Merkel 's campaign focused squarely on  her   years' experience leading Germany through a period of international turmoil  but offered few ideas for the future.

 Merkel 's outgoing government took office nearly three months after Germany's  election  a post-World War II record that could now be exceeded.  Merkel  said  she  won't be able to tell fellow European Union leaders at a summit this week when  her  new administration will be in place.
 She  noted  though  that the Netherlands still hasn't formed a new government after an election in mid-March.

3755,dev,"It didnât generate much attention  but  National Counterterrorism Center Director Nicholas Rasmussen   wrapping up a five-year stint at the NCTC  offered a provocative assessment of what  he  sees as a security threat: U.S. policies on guns.
âWe find ourselves in a more dangerous situation because our population of violent extremists has no difficulty gaining access to weapons that are quite lethal â  Rasmussen  said. âI wish that werenât so.â
While itâs true that  Rasmussen  was appointed to lead the National Counterterrorism Center during the Obama administration  the Washington Post noted that  he âs held âsenior positions at NCTC and the White House in both Republican and Democratic administrations during a -year career in government.â
And while we donât often hear talk connecting gun laws to national security threats   Rasmussen âs comments didnât come out of nowhere.

Ukraineâs intelligence agency on Tuesday detained the former president of Georgia who has emerged as an anti-corruption campaigner in his new country but faced an angry backlash of protesters who would not let the officers to take him away. (Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated Press)
MOSCOW â Hundreds of protesters chanting âKiev  rise up!â blocked Ukrainian police as they tried to arrest  former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili  on Tuesday.  He  later escaped with help from supporters and led them on a march toward parliament  where they planned to call for President Petro Poroshenko to resign.
The detention of  Saakashvili   now an anti-corruption crusader in  his  adopted home and arguably the countryâs most popular opposition politician  has raised fears that Ukraine could be facing its most acute political crisis since the  revolution. Ukrainian prosecutors accuse him of colluding with Ukrainian businessmen who have ties to Russian intelligence as part of an effort to topple  the president .
 Saakashvili  poses a threat to Poroshenko  who appointed  him  as governor of Ukraineâs Odessa region before the two had a falling out.  Saakashvili  resigned in   complaining that  his  efforts to root out corruption were being obstructed by officials.
When the SBU  Ukraineâs Security Service  went to detain  Saakashvili  at his home in Kiev on Tuesday  he climbed onto the roof and reportedly threatened to jump off. SBU officers went after him  detained him and led him to a waiting van.
After  Saakashvili  escaped  he told his supporters that he would âlay down his life for the freedom of Ukraineâ and called on them to follow him to the Supreme Rada. He also called on Ukrainians to rally on Kievâs main square  the epicenter of protests in  and   to demand Poroshenkoâs resignation.
Footage showed  Saakashvili  with the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag around  his  neck marching in central Kiev  surrounded by crowds.
 He  was Georgiaâs president for nearly a decade before  he  was prevented from running again by term limits.  He  left the country in .
Poroshenko revoked Saakashviliâs Ukrainian citizenship in July.  Saakashvili  forced  his  way across Ukraineâs border with Poland earlier this year  with help from protesters.
 Saakashvili âs stand-off with Poroshenko ignited long-simmering popular discontent with the slow pace of reforms the latter has promised.
The Security Service said in a statement that  Saakashvili  is facing a criminal investigation for âassisting members of criminal organizations or hiding their criminal activities.â
 Saakashvili  spearheaded several protests in Kiev  but they typically drew fewer than   people. At one of the rallies   Saakashvili  called on Poroshenko to resign.
âAll the rallies were financed by foreign oligarchs that aimed to seize power by illegal means â Lutsenko said.

3763,dev,"Josh Allen  has come a long  long way and  he âs not done ascending.  He  believes  he  is the best quarterback in this yearâs NFL draft.
âYeah  absolutely ââ  Allen  said Friday at the NFL Scouting Combine. âI think  I donât mean to say that in a cocky way  but I think every quarterback should think that. If youâre not thinking youâre the best quarterback in this draft you probably shouldnât be here. Weâre all different  we all have our pluses  our minuses  but if you donât have the mindset that youâre the best quarterback in this draft youâre not gonna fare well in this league.ââ
Compared with Josh Rosen and Sam Darnold   Allen  is the biggest of the bunch  a -foot-  -pound fastball pitcher with a howitzer for a right arm.  He  could be the quarterback with the greatest upside  but with that potential comes a gamble factor. Strong  athletic and towering   he  is seen by some as the next Carson Wentz.
The big  big arm comes attached to shaky accuracy (. percent this past season) and not much production at middling Wyoming.  He  is not close to ready to play immediately but scouts love to project and  Allen  in time could be the best of the bunch â but also has the highest bust potential  akin to JaMarcus Russell and Kyle Boller  who were athletic  big-armed talents who fizzled in the NFL.
A case can be made that  Allen  would be a smart move for the Giants with the second-overall pick.  He  is raw and would have a year  or two  to hone  his  considerable skills while -year-old Eli Manning finishes up  his  career before passing the torch.
âThatâd be fantastic ââ  Allen  said. âIâve met Eli Manning at the Manning Passing Academy. Heâs a super-reserved guy  but he knows his stuff. Heâs won two Super Bowls  beating Tom Brady  itâs a tough task but heâs done it twice in the Super Bowl. Knowing that organization has the mindset of winning  thatâs what they want to do  would be a blessing  if I got that opportunity to go there and sit behind him for one or two or even three years and just learn everything that I could  grabbing him whenever I had a question and hopefully he would answer it for me.
The Giants were set to meet with  Allen  on Friday night  but they already have a head-start in building a relationship  as new head coach Pat Shurmur met  Allen  at the Senior Bowl in Mobile  Ala.
âCoach Shurmur is a super bright mind  I like him a lot ââ  Allen  said. âSat down with him for a little bit. Heâs a really good dude and if I was fortunate enough to play under him Iâd be super stoked.ââ","['Josh Allen  has come a long  long way and  he â\x80\x99s not done ascending.

But it wasn't until Orange County  Calif.   residents Rida Hamida and Ben Vazquez  created #TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque that someone tried to explore the political potential between Muslims and Mexicans in the United States with  their  shared foodways. The two put on events that are exactly what the hashtag promises. A lonchera parks at a mosque and serves free tacos after a religious service that includes a talk urging Latino-Muslim unity. Visitors feast on tacos of carne asada and chicken prepared by a halal-certified butcher.
It's a perfect meeting ground for Latinos and Muslims in Orange County  a long-conservative place that has changed dramatically since  Hamida  and Vazquez attended high school there during the . Today  Orange County is majority-minority; Latinos make up about a third of the county's . million residents  while an estimated   Muslims live there.
""We're our neighbors  but we don't know one another "" says  Hamida . ""We go and fight for justice at protests and stand side by side  but we really don't know our stories.""
 Hamida  and Vazquez first met at a rally in   and realized they shared a passion for immigrant rights because of their families: Vazquez's parents are from the Mexican state of Zacatecas  while Hamida's family is Palestinian. Their first collaboration happened in  with ""Adventures in Al-Andalus "" a lecture series in high schools that sought to emphasize the commonality of Latinos and Muslims; it also included a voter registration drive at a mosque and a culinary tour of Little Arabia  an Anaheim neighborhood that's the largest Middle Eastern enclave in the United States outside of Michigan.
""It wasn't enough to take the  community out of their space and bring  to a Latino-centric space ""  Hamida  adds. ""It's about bringing that taco truck model that everyone is demonizing  and embracing it and welcoming it to our space.""
 Hamida  assured Muslims that the meats were fully halal  with no contamination. ""We had halal markets cut it taco style and pre-marinate it  to ensure it was halal ""  Hamida  said. Meanwhile   she  says  she  had to convince some Latinos who went to the event that ""eating a halal taco doesn't make you Muslim.  thought they were compromising their own faith!""
The kickoff event drew more than  people. (Hamida's dad ate  tacos). More than   people attended the second happening  held a couple of weeks later at the Islamic Society. Since then  #TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque has traveled as far south as Baja California  in Mexico  and as far north as Sacramento  where they held an event last week. All told   Hamida  estimates  they 've served   people â and nearly   tacos â at the seven events  they 've held so far. ( They 've also inspired imitators.)
The taco tour quickly got national attention â a profile on NBC Nightly News  stories in the Los Angeles Times and PRI's The World.

 Mugabe  the only leader the southern African nation has known since independence from Britain in    was replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa  the deputy he sacked this month in a move that triggered the mid-week intervention by the army.
In scenes unthinkable just a week ago  the announcement drew cheers from the  delegates packed into ZANU-PFâs Harare headquarters to seal the fate of  Mugabe   whose support has crumbled in the four days since the army seized power.
 Mugabe  was given until noon (. a.m. ET) on Monday to resign or face impeachment  an ignominious end to the career of the âGrand Old Manâ of African politics who was once feted across the continent as an anti-colonial liberation hero.
Even in the West   he  was renowned in  his  early years as the âThinking Manâs Guerrillaâ  an ironic nickname for a man who would later proudly declare  he  held a âdegree in violenceâ.
As the economy crumbled and political opposition to  his  rule grew in the late    Mugabe  seized thousands of white-owned farms  detained opponents and unleashed security forces to crush dissent.
When the vote was announced  war veterans leader Chris Mutsvangwa  who has spearheaded an -month campaign to remove a man he openly described as a âdictatorâ  embraced colleagues and shouted: â The President  is gone. Long live  the new President .â
 Mugabe âs -year-old wife Grace  who had harbored ambitions of succeeding her husband  was also expelled from ZANU-PF  along with at least three cabinet ministers who had formed the backbone of her â political faction.
If  Mugabe  refused to go  âwe will bring back the crowds and they will do their business â Mutsvangwa told reporters.

On Saturday  men  women and children ran alongside the armored cars and troops who stepped in to target what the army called âcriminalsâ in  Mugabe âs inner circle.
âYou canât fire a Revolutionary leader!â he wrote on this Facebook page. âZANU-PF is nothing without  President Mugabe .â
Despite the euphoria  some  Mugabe  opponents are uneasy about the prominent role played by the military  and fear Zimbabwe might be swapping one army-backed autocrat for another  rather than allowing the people to choose their next leader.","['HARARE (Reuters) -  Robert Mugabe  agreed on Sunday to resign as Zimbabweâ\x80\x99s president hours after the ruling ZANU-PF party fired him as its leader following  years in charge  a source familiar with the negotiations said.', ""FILE PHOTO:  Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe  looks on as  his  deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa reads a card during  Mugabe 's  birthday celebrations in Harare  Zimbabwe  February   .

President Donald Trump  preparing to board a helicopter to travel from the White House to a North Carolina fundraiser on Saturday  was asked by reporters to weigh in on the embattled Hollywood figure. ""I've known Harvey Weinstein a long time "" Trump replied. When asked if he was surprised by the accusations  the president replied: ""I'm not at all surprised to see it.""

 Weinstein  has exerted power in Hollywood for three decades  producing films including ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Shakespeare in Love "" for which  he  won an Oscar. But  his  stature has diminished in recent years and  his  company has suffered from a string of executive exits  layoffs mounting lawsuits and delayed releases.
The New York Times article chronicled allegations against  Weinstein  from Judd and former employees at both The Weinstein Co. and  Weinstein 's former company  Miramax  over the course of several decades. The report made an enormous impact felt throughout the movie industry and elsewhere.
The board of directors has pressured  Weinstein  to step down from the company  he  helped create  said a person familiar with the board's deliberations who was not authorized to speak publicly.  Weinstein  has resisted  hoping to weather the storm. Discussions between  Weinstein  and the board have been heated and contentious  the person said.
Leadership of the Weinstein Co. will be assumed by Bob Weinstein  who is  Harvey Weinstein's  brother  and David Glasser  the company's chief operating officer.

The brawny  bare-chested Russian leader    was photographed Thursday taking a dip in the frigid cold waters of Lake Seliger  located about five hours northwest of Moscow.  Putin  was celebrating the Epiphany  which in Eastern Christianity  commemorates the baptism of Jesus Christ.
While this most recent outing was spiritual in nature   his  past shirtless endeavors have illustrated  his  fondness for celebrating all things machismo.
One of the most iconic photos -- and one of the first shirtless images to nearly break the Internet -- is of a shirtless  Putin  in August  riding a horse while on vacation outside the town of Kyzyl in Southern Siberia.
And this past August  the leader -- who some may say has a ""dad bod"" -- was photographed sunbathing  fishing and hiking in Southern Siberia.  He  was also photographed sunbathing and fishing with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu  who also dropped  his  top.

Perhaps Kode with  Klossy  could upload lesson videos for scholars to look back on  or start a newsletter with events and internships. Another girl in glasses says she posts tricky coding problems on Snapchat and scholars from her camp offer solutions.
Her first taste came in   when she signed up for a two-week boot camp at adult-education company the Flatiron School in Manhattan to learn the basics of computer programming. ""I didn't actually know who she was "" says Avi Flombaum  cofounder of the Flatiron School  who taught  Kloss â class. ""She was the best student in that group and I was surprised by how enthusiastic she was.""
 Kloss  covered the basics of Ruby on Rails  a popular web development framework. But she quickly noticed that her classes werenât gender equal  an imbalance that mirrored the tech workforce. ""I was curious  why are there not more women in this space?"" recalls  Kloss .

Last summer   Kloss  took the initiative in-house  launching  her  own two-week summer camp for teenage girls aged  to  in New York  Los Angeles and  her  hometown of St. Louis.  Kloss  helped pick candidates  design the curriculum and select teachers;  its  graduates have gone on to win hackathons and land places at Ivy League universities. In June  the program expanded to  cities across the U.S.  with plans to grow further.
Adults are also included:  Last July Kloss  launched a year-long online scholarship with the Flatiron School that selected one woman every month to enroll in its full stack web development course. And whhile other nonprofits with similar missions  such as Girls Who Code and Black Girls Code  are far more established   Kloss'  reach brings  her  objective to millions.
To date  funding for Kode with  Klossy  programs has come from  Kloss   herself  and the brands  she  poses for.

3784,dev,"Far from it  says  Hu Shuli   founder of the financial magazine Caixin.
 Hu  listened one recent afternoon to the theories floating in China's chattering class about why  she  was handing over the editorial reins at Caixin  the only newsroom known for hard-hitting  investigative reporting in China â and dismissed them.
""Laughable rumors  "" Hu  snapped. ""I'm not stepping back or stepping down. You could say I'm stepping up.""
In a rare interview with the Associated Press   Hu  spoke bullishly about transitioning this month into a publisher role at the newsmagazine  she  co-founded in   and about the prospects of the ""Me Too"" movement in China.  She  spoke more guardedly about censorship and declared Caixin as free as ever to conduct its signature muckraking reporting. China watchers say the space for independent journalism in the country  already one of the world's most censored news environments  is fast vanishing under President Xi Jinping.
""We always think there are stories to do and we don't think  'maybe this environment should be better '"" said  Hu . ""We've always felt we could do anything we wanted. It was just based on what our priorities are.""
 Hu  said  she  was handing the operation over to  her  long-time deputy Wang Shuo because of  her  age â  she  turns  this year.  She  will occasionally conduct major interviews and remain involved in major editorial decisions as an adviser to Wang  who  she  hired as a -year-old two decades ago.
Known for her political savvy  for  years  Hu  has published scoops that uncovered corporate malfeasance and government corruption without repercussions while other journalists fell afoul of authorities and landed in jail.  Her  publication blew open the government cover-up of the SARS epidemic in  and has questioned countless deals among powerful companies  including state-backed enterprises.
Caixin's reshuffle comes shortly after Wang Qishan  an official widely seen as  Hu 's longtime ally  stepped down from the Communist Party's top leadership body  said Willy Lam  a political analyst at the Chinese University in Hong Kong.
"" Ms. Hu  is famous for being supercharged  full of energy "" Lam said. ""It's difficult to believe she's stepping aside because of age. It has to do with politics.""
 Hu  declined to discuss her relationship with Wang and denied that political factors were behind her move. In any case  Wang appears to retain significant influence: he joined a parliamentary delegation this week amid speculation that Xi might soon name him vice president.
Pressed nearly two years later   Hu  shook her head  saying she doesn't remember the incident.
Even though she has not directed coverage recently   Hu  said  she  is proud of  her  staff's reporting on sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement in China. Discussion of the subject has sometimes been censored on Chinese social media or branded as a destabilizing foreign movement. But the story has gained some domestic traction  including reports by state-run outlets like the official Xinhua news agency  which  Hu  praised.
""China also has this kind of problem ... China had the 'women hold up half the sky' revolutionary slogan â but the actual situation  the actual status of women â I think is a very profound issue "" said  Hu   adding that  she  wanted to do more to promote #MeToo.
 Hu  said most of  her  energy will be focused on developing Caixin's business model.
In October the company became the first Chinese news company to erect a paywall  a decision  Hu  made based on the success of leading western newspapers.  She  declined to discuss subscription or revenue numbers  but acknowledged that online revenues are not yet considered ""substantial.""
Wei Wuhui  a lecturer of new media at Shanghai Jiaotong University who was asked by  Hu  to consult on Caixin's paywall model last year  said the increasingly restrictive political atmosphere will affect Caixin.

3789,dev,"Saturday's events are an extraordinary show of support for the military's move to step in and put longtime President Robert Mugabe under house arrest. Impatient Zimbabweans are urging the reluctant Mugabe to step aside.
The Zimbabwe Grounds were chosen for the symbolism. The location is where Zimbabweans gathered to cheer  Mugabe 's return from exile in  after the liberation war from white minority rule.
Now the crowds wish to meet there and urge  Mugabe 's departure.
Opponents of  Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe  are preparing to demonstrate for the ouster of the -year-old leader who is virtually powerless and deserted by most of  his  allies.
Zimbabwe's generals have placed  Mugabe  under house arrest and have allowed  him  limited movement while talks on  his  exit from office unfold. But many Zimbabweans are growing impatient and want  him  to leave immediately.
Protesters hope a big turnout on Saturday will speed up the official end of  Mugabe 's rule  which is widely blamed for the collapse of an economy that was once one of Africa's wealthiest.","[""Saturday's events are an extraordinary show of support for the military's move to step in and put longtime President Robert Mugabe under house arrest.

The Television Academy says its leadership voted Monday to ban the producer for life.  Weinstein  is primarily known as a film producer but  his  former company is also responsible for hit television series such as ""Project Runway.""
The expulsion is the latest honor  Weinstein  has lost. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild have also revoked his membership.
 Weinstein 's representative Sallie Hofmeister did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
On Monday  a new report published in The New Yorker says  Harvey Weinstein  used a so-called ""army of spies"" to try to block the reporting of sexual misconduct allegations against  him .

3791,dev,"OBSERVERS of Asma Jahangir  usually male ones  would sometimes ask why  she  was so angry. From the  onwards  she  seemed at the centre of every demonstration in Lahore or Islamabad  all five feet two inches of  her   glasses glinting  gesticulating  shouting.  She  led marches  held marathons  set up awkward organisations  and in every way was a gadfly. Most of all   she  spoke  her  mind. It might be in the bar room of the Lahore High Court  through a furious cloud of beedi smoke  or in court itself  dressing down judges who didnât get the point  or at a police station  still protesting. Bemused by this fierce little lawyer  the men would shake their heads.
But in Pakistan  how could  she  be silent? There was so much pent-up anger  for so many reasons. Lack of democracy. Almost total lack of justice. Duffer generals  bigoted mullahs  crony capitalists  chauvinist men. Certainly  she  could be a well-behaved upper-middle-class woman  in elegant shalwar kameez in  her  wood-panelled house. But  she  would rather be a street fighter. Of course   she  paid for it.  She  was bundled into police vans  put under house arrest.  Her  car was trashed. Hitmen held  her  relatives hostage. The intelligence services tried to liquidate  her  as a traitor and foreign agent (though  her  early death was natural). Every attack left  her  more energised than ever. When  her  shirt was torn off for organising a protest   she  saved  her  modesty with safety pins and went on hectoring. Briefly in jail in    she  thought it a great adventure.
 Her  model was  her  father  a parliamentarian who had resigned in  to protest against military rule. He too had gone smiling  and often  to prison. As a teenager  she  was already a troublemaker  complaining at  her  convent about the undemocratic selection of the head girl. In  her  prim school uniform   she  also scaled the gate of the Punjab governorâs house to plant a black flag against military rule. Rustication followed  to  her  joy.
When the phone rang at  her  law offices in Lahore   she  would always answer it. If  she  missed a call   she  would swiftly return it. Someone needed help  and  she  was often the only person in the country they could turn to.  Her  critics sometimes accused  her  of profiting from adversity  being a glory seeker. On the contrary   she  was defending democracy  secularism  judicial independence  human rights. Simple tenets  but not in Pakistan.  She  had come to the law enchanted with it  studying it at home because  she  was debarred  as a woman  from lectures.  She  believed in its power to right wrongs.  Her  tartness in court expressed  her  fury with the slow  corrupt  uneven way it actually worked.
High-profile cases did not attract  her .  She  preferred to defend a -year-old Christian boy accused of scrawling blasphemy on the wall of a village mosque  and to save him from the death penalty  which  she  abhorred. Though  she  was Muslim  herself   it was a personal matter.  She  accepted the place of sharia in the legal system of Pakistan  but battled its harsher interpretations. In   she  helped set up the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP)  the first of its kind  to keep an eye on things.  Her  presence on the Lahore High Court and later as the first woman president of the Supreme Court Bar Association  encouraged liberal lawyers and outraged conservatives  whom  she  mocked for their backwardness and beards.
 She  was eager to represent the poor. In half  her  cases  she  took no payment. For a time  she  even funnelled money to struggling families of political prisoners and abductees. Once  she  fought for a group of half-naked bonded brickmakers  who owed thousands of rupees to their employers. When the judge asked  her  why  she  had brought people into his court who stank   she  replied  bluntly  that he was there precisely for them. Ideally  to weaken the feudal system that enslaved them. At the least  to listen to the victims.
And no group was victimised more than women. They were treated as possessions in Pakistan  beings who should not question and should not think.  She  knew about that. As a young mother  even with a law degree   she  had been forbidden to work and reduced to a nothing. So in   she    her  sister Hina and two friends set up the first all-woman law firm in the country.  Her  husband objected  but  she  went ahead. The year before President Zia ul-Haq had brought in military rule and severe hudood punishments  so  her  firm was needed.  She  defended girls  raped by their bosses  who now faced flogging for fornication;  she  helped women trying to escape loveless marriages  one of whom was killed in  her  law offices at  her  motherâs instigation.  She  provided a shelter for them  again the first. By this year  she  felt women had made progress. But not nearly enough.
With so much energy and noise   she  was noticed internationally.  She  became a UN special rapporteur for human rights  travelling to Iran  Afghanistan  Palestine and Chiapas. All the cases  she  encountered caused  her  anguish  but  her  chief concern remained Pakistan. For all the danger to  her    she  had never thought of leaving.  Her  ancestors were buried there.

3794,dev,"And since everyone is equal under the law  even in Illinois  Iâd bet that  Illinoisâ supreme political boss  Democratic House Speaker Mike Madigan  lord of all he surveys   is taking his sexual harassment training too.
No one in their right mind would ever think  Boss Madigan  capable of sexual harassment.  He âs a family man  a gentleman  loving dad and husband  brilliant  hardworking and incredibly disciplined.
 He âs also a ruthless  wealthy political warlord who controls Illinois by force of will and has turned the state into an overtaxed wasteland.
 Madigan  is of the old school: strait-laced iron curtain; a character straight out of Charles Dickens  thin  bony and entirely without blood.
 He  likes money and power. But sex and  Mike Madigan ? Impossible.
It took me over two hours just to type the words âsexâ and â Mike Madigan â in the same sentence. And now my fingers are cramped and Iâll probably have to stick pins in them or soak them in holy water to release the painful claw effect.
 He  stands accused but not charged  though  he âs been stripped by the powers that be of  his  leadership position and the extra cash that comes with it.

3799,dev,"WASHINGTON (AP) â  Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold  announced Thursday that  he  won't seek re-election next year  adding  his  name to the list of lawmakers leaving Congress amid sexual harassment allegations that have cost powerful men their jobs in politics  the arts and other industries.
In a five-minute video on  his  campaign's Facebook page   Farenthold  denied a former aide's three-year-old accusations  which included that  he 'd subjected  her  to sexually suggestive comments and behavior and then fired  her  after  she  complained. But  he  apologized for an office atmosphere  he  said included ""destructive gossip  offhand comments  off-color jokes and behavior that in general was less than professional.""
House Speaker Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  told reporters  he 'd spoken twice to the Texan on Wednesday and suggested there were additional accusations that had yet to surface.
""Unacceptable behavior has been alleged in those stories  and I think  he 's made the right decision that  he 's going to be leaving Congress and that reflects some of the conversations we've had "" Ryan said.
 Farenthold 's decision comes as congressional leaders have shown little desire for lawmakers facing credible harassment allegations to remain in Congress as  elections roll into view.
Democrats had criticized Ryan for not forcing  Farenthold  out sooner. But Republicans cited a recommendation by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics that the House Ethics Committee dismiss the allegations.
""There is not substantial reason to believe that  Representative Farenthold  sexually harassed or discriminated against complainant "" the office had said.
 Farenthold   a seven-year House veteran  had said he'd engaged in no wrongdoing when he settled the case in . But after congressional sources said he'd paid the $  settlement using taxpayers' money  the House Ethics Committee said last week it would investigate him and public focus intensified  even though he said he'd reimburse the Treasury Department.

In his video   Farenthold  said if he stayed in Congress  he'd have to spend months trying to vindicate himself.
The lawsuit by former  Farenthold  aide Lauren Greene alleged that the congressman had discussed his sexual fantasies about her and said at a staff meeting that a lobbyist had propositioned him for a threesome. It accused  Farenthold  of repeatedly complimenting her appearance  then joking that he hoped the comments wouldn't be construed as sexual harassment.
Five Republicans filed to challenge  Farenthold  in Texas' March  Republican primary even before he resigned.

Barth  like others in the article  alleges that she was invited under the guise of a business meeting to  Weinstein 's hotel room  where she says he proceeded to demand a naked massage.
After telling  Weinstein   ""Thatâs not going to happen "" Barth says she left the room and started crying uncontrollably.
Barth's former director and co-star for her appearances in the ""Ted"" films  Seth MacFarlane  took to Twitter today to explain a joke he made about  Weinstein  when the actor hosted the Oscars in .
After listing off the nominees in the supporting actress category that year  MacFarlane said  âCongratulations  you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.""
Today  he elaborated  writing  ""In   my friend and colleague Jessica Barth  with whom I worked on the 'Ted' films  confided in me regarding her encounter with Harvey Weinstein and his attempted advances.""
The ""Family Guy"" creator applauded Barth and the other women who spoke out about their alleged experiences with  Weinstein .
In response to the women who spoke out on Tuesday  a spokesperson for the movie executive told The New Yorker: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by  Mr. Weinstein .""
 ""Mr. Weinstein  has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing  his  advances.

 Weinstein  was terminated on Sunday  days after the first New York Times article came out citing years of alleged abuse and eight confidential settlements from the producer to accusers. In response to those claims   Weinstein  acknowledged that  he  has ""caused a lot of pain"" and apologized for  his  inappropriate behavior and added  ""I so respect all women and regret what happened.""
But  Weinstein 's attorney Charles Harder also told ABC News in a statement that the Times' report from last Thursday was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"" about the movie mogul  and added he is currently preparing a lawsuit against the paper.

3806,dev,"Another Famous Conductor   Charles Dutoit   Accused Of Sexual Assault
The Associated Press has reported allegations of sexual assault against the famed conductor  Charles Dutoit  made by four women  in incidents that span from  to  and that took place in five different U.S. cities.
After the AP published its report Thursday  six major American orchestras with decades-long ties to  Dutoit  â the Philadelphia Orchestra  the Boston Symphony Orchestra  the New York Philharmonic  the Chicago Symphony Orchestra  the Cleveland Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony â hastily issued separate statements that distanced the respective institutions from the conductor to varying degrees.
In Britain  the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra also responded to the allegations  writing in a statement that it and  Dutoit  have "" jointly agreed to release  him  from  his  forthcoming concert obligations with the Orchestra for the immediate future.""
The alleged victims include one world-famous vocalist  the Grammy winning-soprano Sylvia McNair. Now   McNair told the AP that  Dutoit  ""tried to have  his  way"" with her after a rehearsal at the Minnesota Orchestra in   when she was  years old.
Paula Rasmussen  a former professional mezzo-soprano  alleges that  Dutoit  assaulted her in his dressing room at the Los Angeles Opera in September .
The other two accusers chose to remain anonymous  due to  Dutoit 's still-significant power within the classical music world.
One of those women  an anonymous soprano  claims that  Dutoit  assaulted her three times in   at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs  N.Y.  and again in Philadelphia  in .
The fourth accuser was  years old at the time of her alleged assault. She was a musician at the Civic Orchestra of Chicago  a ""training"" orchestra for emerging professional players associated with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO)  when  Dutoit  came to the city as a guest conductor of the CSO. She says he invited her to a lunch originally scheduled at a restaurant but then changed  at  Dutoit 's request  to his hotel suite at the Four Seasons  where he tried to force himself on her. In a series of emails the conductor allegedly sent to her afterwards  he wrote that he did not know that ""that an affectionate hug and kiss could have such a negative effect "" but that ""of course  I forgot you are still a child.""
The Philadelphia Orchestra â which Dutoit has conducted some  times since  â said in a statement this evening that it was ""horrified to learn of  the deeply troubling accusations of sexual misconduct against Charles Dutoit . We had no knowledge of these allegations. The Association is committed to providing a safe and respectful work environment for all of its employees and guest artists. We have had no communication with Mr. Dutoit and he has no future engagements."" The Philadelphia symphony added  ""We deplore the type of behavior described by Mr. Dutoit's accusers and we recognize
our responsibility to be a forceful opponent of abuses of power. The seriousness of  the accusations  demands a thorough investigation. We offer our sincerest sympathy to those who have been impacted.""
 Dutoit 's upcoming U.S. performances were largely tied to a series of appearances with pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet  a longtime musical colleague: with the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center and with London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in a tour of California next month; with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Boston's Symphony Hall and with the Cleveland Orchestra at Cleveland's Severance Hall in February; and with the Chicago Symphony in April at the city's Symphony Center.
Thibaudet declined to comment on the allegations against  Dutoit .
Rather than make any declarations about future collaborations with  Dutoit  â or about anyone in the Philharmonic administration or orchestra's knowledge of his alleged behaviors â the New York orchestra released a brief statement Thursday night that said: ""In the wake of the very serious allegations reported today about  conductor Charles Dutoit    Mr. Dutoit  informed the New York Philharmonic that  he  has withdrawn from conducting concerts for the New York Philharmonic scheduled for January   . The New York Philharmonic remains committed to providing a professional and safe workplace  free of sexual harassment and all other forms of inappropriate conduct.""
After an initial statement in which the Chicago Symphony said it was taking the allegations seriously and was still determining the best course to follow  the CSO ultimately took a similar tack to the New York Philharmonic. In a terse statement  the CSO said: ""In response to the allegations about  conductor Charles Dutoit  reported in the media today   Mr. Dutoit  informed the Chicago Symphony Association (CSOA) that  he  has withdrawn from conducting concerts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra scheduled for March      and    and April      and   . The CSOA is committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from intimidation  coercion and harassment  including sexual harassment.""
Also Thursday  the Boston Symphony Orchestra  which was scheduled to feature Dutoit as a guest conductor in a series of February performances  released a statement severing its decadeslong ties with the conductor: ""Given the extremely troubling allegations against  Charles Dutoit  reported by Associated Press this morning  the Boston Symphony Orchestra will end its relationship with  him  and  he  will no longer appear as a guest conductor with the orchestra. The Boston Symphony Orchestra is committed to a zero tolerance policy towards anyone who exhibits inappropriate behavior in the workplace  and behavior that runs counter to these core values will always be met with serious consequences.""

Texas A&M is expected to inquire about the interest level of Florida State coach  Jimbo Fisher  once its separation from current coach Kevin Sumlin is official at the end of the season  according to two people familiar with the situation.
Though  Fisher  has never given serious consideration to leaving Florida State previously  rebuffing interest from LSU the last two years  one person close to  Fisher  pointed to  his  longstanding relationship with Texas A&M athletics director Scott Woodward and the current disappointing season at Florida State as reasons why Texas A&Mâs pursuit might be more realistic.
Woodward arrived as an administrator at LSU in   the same year  Fisher  was hired there as offensive coordinator under Nick Saban. They have remained in touch and friendly over the years  according to a person familiar with Fisherâs thinking.
Itâs far more uncertain whether  Fisher  would ultimately decide to leave a school where  he  has invested eight seasons as a head coach and three as the coach-in-waiting under Bobby Bowden  restoring the Seminoles to their former glory during a run of three consecutive ACC titles between -.
 Fisher  also has security at Florida State  as  he  is signed at $. million annually through the  season. The contract contains two automatic one-year rollovers that go into effect after each nine-win regular season.
Another significant factor is  his  family situation. Fisher and his ex-wife Candi divorced in December   and their youngest son Ethan battles Fanconi anemia  a rare blood disorder. In previous discussions  staying close to his children has been a factor in  Fisher âs thinking about other jobs.
However  this season has gone poorly for  Fisher   as the Seminoles started at No.  in the polls but have stumbled to a - record. If he stays   Fisher  will be expected to tweak his coaching staff  as the Seminoles have been out of the ACC title race by the end of September each of the last two years.
Last month  after Florida Stateâs - home loss to Louisville   Fisher  confronted a fan who yelled âNew coaches  new coaches!â as the team walked off the field.
 Jimbo Fisher  talks about getting into it with a fan that was calling for coaching changes after the loss to - Louisville. pic.twitter.com/ â Warchant.com (@Warchant) October   
Last week  when  Fisher  was asked about Florida Stateâs rivalry with Clemson   he  added fuel to the fire with a comment that seemed to indicate  he  believes Clemson  with its new $ million football facility  has surpassed Florida State in its financial commitment to winning national titles.
âI think their rise has come from their commitment to football â  Fisher  said. âTheyâve been committed but their administration has done a tremendous job of spending and doing and building. Not just building  but all the things behind the scenes.â
Asked what commitments  he âd like to see from Florida State   Fisher  responded: âThose things are a major  major deal. Unfortunately  in this business  when you get into the facilities business  youâre never out of it. Youâre never out of development. Your company can never quit growing. Whether itâs that or behind the scenes things  support staff  all that can never happen. It can never go away. If it does  people fly by you like crazy. And thereâs numerous examples across this country. If you donât understand that  youâre missing the boat.â
Those comments were not well-received among FSU fans and administrators  particularly given the contract extension  Fisher  received last December and the multimillion-dollar facility upgrades the school has made under  his  watch.
Fisherâs contract states that his only buyout responsibility to Florida State if he left would be the amount guaranteed to his assistant coaches â potentially as much as $. million  but likely far less â as the contract is written in a way to protect the school from having to buy out those staff members should a new coach decide not to honor those contracts. In other words  if  Fisher  brought some or most of those staff members to a new school  their salaries likely wouldnât be owed to Florida State.","[""Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE SportsPulse: USA TODAY Sports' Paul Myerberg breaks down the Auburn Tigers' and Miami Hurricanes' big wins and what it means going forward.

Not just building  but all the things behind the scenes.â', 'Asked what commitments  he âd like to see from Florida State   Fisher  responded: âThose things are a major  major deal. Unfortunately  in this business  when you get into the facilities business  youâre never out of it. Youâre never out of development. Your company can never quit growing. Whether itâs that or behind the scenes things  support staff  all that can never happen. It can never go away. If it does  people fly by you like crazy. And thereâs numerous examples across this country. If you donât understand that  youâre missing the boat.â', 'Those comments were not well-received among FSU fans and administrators  particularly given the contract extension  Fisher  received last December and the multimillion-dollar facility upgrades the school has made under  his  watch.', 'Fisherâs contract states that his only buyout responsibility to Florida State if he left would be the amount guaranteed to his assistant coaches â potentially as much as $. million  but likely far less â as the contract is written in a way to protect the school from having to buy out those staff members should a new coach decide not to honor those contracts.

The lawsuit  filed in U.S. District Court in New York  does not accuse  Weinstein  of labor trafficking or other exploitations commonly associated with the commercial sex industry. But the criminal law on which the civil claim in based bans the use of force  threat or coercion for a sex act in exchange for value.
Nobleâs lawsuit claimed  Weinstein  promised  her  a role in a Weinstein Company project and that he invited  her  to his hotel room in February  in France on the premise of viewing  her  show reel  or video highlights of  her  acting.
Responding to the lawsuit  Holly Baird  a spokeswoman for  Weinstein   on Monday denied the allegation of non-consensual sex. Baird could not be reached on Tuesday for comment on the claim that  Weinstein  violated sex trafficking laws.

3826,dev,"PORT ST. LUCIE â It sounds as if  David Wright  finally has come to the realization â and to grips with â the likelihood that the end is near.
 Wright  spoke for the first time this spring at Mets camp on Saturday  and while  he  admirably refuses to give up on  his  multi-year quest to make it back to the field following multiple surgeries  the hobbled captain fully understands why the organization signed Todd Frazier as a more permanent replacement at third base this offseason.
 He  also understands why the Mets simply and clearly could not wait for  him  any longer.
âIâm going to give it my best shot  certainly. I probably have a lot of the same questions that youâre asking me  and a lot of people are asking of me. Because I just donât know â  Wright  said when asked in the home dugout at First Data Field how realistic  he  believes a return this season would be for  him . âItâs certainly been an uphill climb for me  so I guess to honestly answer your question  I donât know. Iâm not sure what the expectation is.
 Wright âs body has gone through more pain and trouble in the past few seasons than any pro athlete should have to endure  from the spinal stenosis that first was diagnosed in  to the neck  back and shoulder surgeries the seven-time All-Star third baseman has undergone over the past two lost years of  his  career.
âCertainly  (itâs been) very frustrating â  the -year-old Wright  said. âWhen youâre used to doing something your entire life  and itâs kind of taken away from you  itâs definitely frustrating.
 David Wright  discusses the frustrations surrounding trying to get healthy. (Howard Simmons/New York Daily News)
For practically  years now   Wright  has been one of the most amicable and productive players ever produced by the Mets organization  and as such  I remain firmly in the camp that the decision to call it a career is  his  and  his  alone.
True to form   Wright  walked into Mickey Callawayâs office earlier in the week to ask what the new managerâs leadership expectations were of  him  while still rehabbing. âI would think everyone in baseball is rooting for  David Wright  to come back "" Callaway said.
If not  the Mets recouped  percent of  Wright âs $ million salary last season  and will do so on the remaining three years and $ million owed  him  should  he  never resume a career that once seemed to be on a Hall of Fame trajectory.
âIâve had a hard time with it certainly  but I guess you do what you can do and do everything in your power â  Wright  said. âThe biggest thing is I donât want to say when itâs all said and done I wish I would have done this or I wish I would have done that.
To that end   Wright  still has not even resumed running or any baseball activity. So even while saying  he  hopes to âbegin to try to ramp it up a little bit moreâ in the coming weeks  any immediate return appears out of the question anyway.
Which is why the Mets were fully justified in signing Frazier to a two-year deal to man third base for the next seasons after a couple of years of keeping the light on for  him  by mostly patch-working the position together.
âJeff (Wilpon) called me the night that it came out  which I very much appreciated  and he said he wanted to give me a heads up that  âhey  this is going to happenâ and that certainly meant a lot to me â  Wright  said. âThe way I look at is that weâre certainly  in my opinion  a very good team without me and my mindset is that weâll be a better team with both of us out there.
Another typically diplomatic response  to be sure  but itâs impossible for  even Wright  to ignore that the Frazier signing finally represents some concession by the Mets that he can no longer be counted on to come back successfully.","['PORT ST.

In defending  his  stance on Griffey   Showalter  said  he  hopes  his  criticism of the superstar doesn't detract from Griffey's ability or work ethic. But ""in some form I feel that way  "" Showalter  said. ""For me to be apologizing for something I feel  that's not right.""
It's not Mariners versus Yankees in Seattle this weekend so much as Griffey versus  Showalter   perhaps the game's premier player against one of  its  brightest young managers in a lively discourse on the merits of respecting the game.

3829,dev,"After  Nikola Mirotic  failed to evoke significant interest in restricted free agency last year  the Bulls and  his  representatives agreed on an intriguing proposal.
Rather than play this season on  his  $. million qualifying offer  why not make a higher annual salary on a two-year  $ million deal structured with a team option that could make Mirotic eminently tradable at some point in the deal?
And if  Mirotic  played well  which  he  has   he  might be able to net a first-round pick in return. Plus  the Bulls were â and still are â under the salary-cap floor.
The notion that itâs a matter of when  not if   Mirotic  is dealt picked up steam Tuesday.
Indeed  the creative structure to  Mirotic âs deal is both blessing and curse. The collective bargaining agreement allows  Mirotic  the right to reject a trade if the second-year team option isnât exercised.
 Mirotic  has never backed off  his  claim to want to be elsewhere â and start â after Bobby Portisâ punch Oct.  broke two facial bones and cost  Mirotic   games. The deal had attractiveness to it. Last season   Mirotic  called Rajon Rondo  now with the Pelicans  his favorite teammate along with Pau Gasol. And heâd start for a team challenging for the playoffs.
But sources said  Mirotic   for now  ultimately soured on waiving  his  guaranteed $. million next season  not to mention  his  Bird rights. Those allow a team to go over the salary cap to sign  him  to a deal with higher annual raises than signing via a salary-cap exception.
Whether Miroticâs stance changes before the Feb.  trade deadline remains to be seen. The Bulls also could pick up his option â which negates  Mirotic âs ability to reject a trade â and then find a trading partner.
The Bulls and Jazz also remain in talks  sources said  and  Mirotic  is intrigued by the idea of playing for coach Quin Snyder.
 Mirotic  experienced an emotional day.  It  began with  him  testing  his  strained left leg on the practice floor. Then  he  got pulled into an office by coach Fred Hoiberg and ultimately left the facility while a practice  he  wasnât scheduled to participate in took place.
Sources said the decision weighed on  Mirotic  heavily.  He  ultimately boarded the Bulls charter flight to Portland  Ore.  on Tuesday afternoon.
Before that  Hoiberg was purposely vague regarding Miroticâs playing status. He answered âweâll seeâ and later that heâd âanticipate that he wouldâ when asked before practice if  Mirotic  would travel.

3835,dev,"MOSCOW â A court in Georgia on Friday sentenced  former President Mikheil Saakashvili  in absentia to three years in prison for abusing  his  power in the pardoning of four policemen convicted of murdering a banker.
Saakashvili  who was president -  left Georgia when his presidency ended and eventually went to Ukraine  where he had been appointed governor of the Odessa region. He resigned in  and harshly criticized President Petro Poroshenko. The Ukrainian leader last year stripped Saakashvili of his citizenship while he was abroad;  Saakashvili  returned to Ukraine in September and has led a series of protests against the government.
A court in the Georgian capital  Tbilisi  sentenced  Saakashvili  on Friday. Georgia has requested Saakashviliâs extradition  but Ukraine has not complied.
The verdict âis completely illegal and contradicts all international  national norms and common sense â  Saakashvili  said on Facebook. âJudging  the president  for using the right to pardon  which is not limited in any way  speaks about the completely political nature of this process.â
The countryâs politics is dominated by a collation headed by the Georgian Dream party  which arose in opposition to  Saakashvili .
 Saakashvili âs conviction stems from the  beating death of banker Sandro Girgvliani.  His  body was found the morning after  he  had been involved in an argument with Interior Ministry officials in a Tbilisi cafe. Critics said the investigation of the killing was carried out poorly and reluctantly;  Saakashvili  was a close associate of then-Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili.","['MOSCOW â\x80\x94 A court in Georgia on Friday sentenced  former President Mikheil Saakashvili  in absentia to three years in prison for abusing  his  power in the pardoning of four policemen convicted of murdering a banker.', 'Saakashvili  who was president -  left Georgia when his presidency ended and eventually went to Ukraine  where he had been appointed governor of the Odessa region.

3837,dev,"With  Mayor Rahm Emanuel  looking on from  his  perch at the front of council chambers  aldermen criticized and cajoled  trying to build support or stoke opposition among colleagues on the issue of giving Presence Health a $. million tax subsidy to help pay for its downtown corporate headquarters.
 Emanuel   whoâs been trying to rebuild  his  standing among black voters ahead of a  re-election bid  backed the tax subsidy. Even as the meeting was underway   his  aides arm-twisted aldermen  trying to keep down the number of ânoâ votes.
In the end  the mayor won  as has been the norm at City Hall in the decades since then-Mayor Richard M. Daley consolidated power on the fifth floor. But the - tally proved to be one of the closest margins  Emanuel  has faced during  his  nearly seven years as mayor  and following the roll call  he  took to the microphone and launched into an animated lecture.
Sweeping  his  arms out toward the aldermen and jabbing  his  finger on  his  desk   Emanuel  admonished those who opposed the deal for applying what  he  termed a sudden âlitmus testâ on abortion.
âWe never raised a question on (money for hospitals like) St. Anthony  Norwegian  Mercy  Swedish Covenant â said  Emanuel    his  voice rising as  he  listed earlier city financial help for private health care companies.
âNot a peep  not a sound about a litmus test â  he  added.
Still  even as  he  scolded aldermen who opposed  him    Emanuel  dedicated several minutes of  his  speech to bolstering  his  own bona fides on health care.
The mayor dipped back into his political history to mention his role as President Barack Obamaâs chief of staff in helping get the Affordable Care Act passed  though  Emanuel  had cautioned the president against pursuing what became Obamacare  warning he would lose the  election if he pursued it.

 Emanuel  also touted  his  work to expand health care for children as an adviser in the Clinton White House. And  he  recalled  his  family history as the son of a pediatrician who  he  said ânever  ever turned away anyone who couldnât pay.â
In addition   the mayor  pointed to  his  own â percent recordâ on voting on reproductive rights while  he  was in Congress.  Emanuel  said supporting Presence wasnât an âeither-orâ vote on abortion rights but rather a question of giving people access to health care.
Ald. Ameya Pawar  however  said  Emanuel  portrayed the issue as exactly that.
The  Ward alderman said Emanuelâs argument that council members were hypocritical on the matter was âdisingenuous.â The other votes  the mayor  cited  Pawar said  did not involve taxpayer funding for a corporate office in the Loop. The Swedish Covenant example was not relevant because that hospital does not have the same abortion policy as Presence  the alderman added.
Asked about the relatively tight vote   Emanuel  replied that the measure âpassed by nearly  to .â
At a post-meeting news conference   Emanuel  said  he  thinks Presence opponents suddenly started complaining about the companyâs abortion policies to make political hay out of the issue in the February  municipal elections  when all  City Council seats and the mayorâs office will be on the ballot.

Earlier this week  UPMC released a statement saying that  Shazier  had begun rehabilitation  but little information has been made public about  his  condition.

Some Pittsburgh players have been wearing cleats with the message âShalieve â and the team gave  Shazier  the game ball last week after clinching the AFC North title with a win over the Ravens.

âWeâre not done with this â  the -year-old Bundy  declared in his first minutes of freedom since his arrest in February .
The stunning collapse of  the federal criminal case against Cliven Bundy and his sons Ryan and Ammon  marked a new low for government lawyers whose work is now under review by the Trump administration. Prosecutors have faced several losses in Oregon and Nevada arising from  armed Bundy  standoffs over federal control of vast stretches of land in the U.S. West.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions launched an investigation into  the Nevada case  last month after Chief U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro declared a mistrial. On Monday  she dismissed outright all  counts against  Bundy   his sons and Montana militia leader Ryan Payne.
âThe court finds that the universal sense of justice has been violated â Navarro said as audible gasps and sobs erupted in a court gallery crammed with  Bundy  supporters.
Jurors in Portland  Oregon  also acquitted Ryan and  Ammon Bundy  more than a year ago of taking over a federal wildlife refuge in early  and calling for the U.S. government to turn over public land to local control.
Navarro set a Feb.  trial date for four defendants still awaiting trial  including two more  Bundy  sons  Mel and David.

3843,dev,"A report by the Cato Institute released on February   reveals that illegal immigrants are much more likely to commit violent crimes than immigrants who follow the law to get here. Cato primarily provides written analysis on the portion of the report showing illegal immigrants less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.
 The report by the Cato Institutesâ Alex Nowrasteh  attempts to debunk the positions of President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security that illegal immigrants are a âsignificant source of crime.â To do so  the writer analyzed reports from the Texas Department of Public Safety and looked at crime statistics for native-born Americans  legal immigrants  and illegal immigrants.
Cato chose Texas because the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) cooperates with immigration officials and therefore has more accurate breakdowns of crimes and arrests by immigration/citizenship status  the report states. While  the report  seeks to paint a picture that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans  it also shows that people who come to the U.S. by illegally entering the country in violation of laws are much more likely to commit additional crimes than people who immigrate here by following the law.
 The report  looks at Texas DPS crime statistics for .
For example  Catoâs charts show that illegal immigrants are nearly  percent more likely to be convicted of a crime in Texas than a legal immigrant. Compared to native-born Americans  illegal immigrants are convicted at less than half the rate.
Illegal immigrants led the other categories in four types of crimes in Texas â gambling  kidnapping  smuggling  and vagrancy â Cato states. However  these cases are small in number and account for . percent of all criminal convictions in the Lone Star State.
In terms of arrests for various crimes  Cato reports similar numbers. Illegal immigrants are about  percent more likely than legal immigrants to be arrested on any criminal charge  but are  percent less likely than the numbers of native-born Americans arrested. Similar rates apply for arrests for homicide  but illegal immigrants are more likely than native-born Americans to be arrested for sexual assault â but not for convictions for the alleged assaults.
 Catoâs  conclusion:
 Catoâs  conclusion and analysis throughout point out the comparison between crimes committed by native-born Americans and illegal immigrants and the comparison of crimes by legal immigrants versus native-born Americans. However  Cato appears to ignore the comparison of crimes committed by illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. with an initial mindset of violating immigration law versus legal immigrants who follow U.S. immigration law to move to this country. While the facts are shown in the charts  the written analysis does not make reference to comparisons between legal and illegal immigrants.","['A report by the Cato Institute released on February   reveals that illegal immigrants are much more likely to commit violent crimes than immigrants who follow the law to get here.

Then  he  beat Ann Richards â a cult figure in the state â by  points. When  he  won  his  re-election as governor   Bush  got an astounding  percent of the vote.  Al Gore  was a virtual shoe-in to win the presidency in . A two-term vice president who inherited a healthy economy   Gore  then lost in a head-to-head race with  Bush . For four straight years  Democrats mocked  him  as an inarticulate fool. With  his  approval rating tanking as the Iraq War became an obvious quagmire   Bush  still won re-election against then-Sen. John Kerry. Say what you want   George W. Bush  was a nearly unbeatable politician.
Trump is a Godzilla of a political opponent.  He  wields  his  . million Twitter followers   million Facebook followers  and . million Instagram followers to not just dominate and shape every single news cycle  but to mock and ridicule  his  opponents.  He  has a media machine â Fox News  Breitbart  and increasingly places like the Wall Street Journal â that are more than willing to amplify  his  message. And  at the receiving end  there are millions of people who will believe  him  and vote for  him .
 He  literally told over   lies in  his  first year in office yet consistently goes on about âfake news.â On Wednesday   he  had the gall to say  he  wished the United States had tougher libel laws to hold people accountable for their dishonest attacks.
Trump won  different states in the  general election. Sixty-three million people voted for  him . Even though  he  was the least popular presidential candidate in the history of modern politics   he  won.  He âs now the president of the United States. And  he  got there even after more than a dozen women came forward to say  he  sexually assaulted or harassed them. Trump was elected even after a recording was released of  him  admitting  he  sexually assaults women.  He  was elected even after mocking Sen. John McCain  R-Ariz.  for being a prisoner of war.  He  was elected even after blaming the questioning  he  received from a debate moderator on  her  menstrual cycle.

3849,dev,"Former Vice President Joe Biden  says  he  and President Obama decided not to speak out publicly on Russian interference during the  campaign after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to sign a bipartisan statement condemning the Kremlin's role.
Speaking on Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations   Biden  said the Obama administration sought a united front to dispel concerns that going public with such accusations would be seen as an effort to undermine the legitimacy of the election.
At that point   Biden  added  he felt that ""the die had been cast"" and that ""this was all about the political play.""

3852,dev,"In   when  Fernando SÃ¡nchez  was  years old   he  dug through rubble in search of life at the site of a collapsed factory in the center of Mexico City. An unknown number of garment workers  mostly women  lost their lives in that factory following the . magnitude earthquake  and  SÃ¡nchez  was among the rescue crew that tried to save them.
Thirty-two years and approximately six hours later  a . earthquake shook Mexicoâs core again  and  SÃ¡nchez  found  himself  at the site of another collapsed garment factory  a few blocks away from the building that fell in . This time   he  arrived as a desperate family member  searching for  his  -year-old mother  Maria Teresa Lira Infante  and  his  sister  Maria Elena SÃ¡nchez Lira  aged   who labored in a dress-beading workshop inside.
âFrom a distance   saw that a building had collapsed and prayed to all the forces in the universe that it wasnât theirs â  SÃ¡nchez  told The Intercept. âAs I got closer  I saw that it was their building and just hoped that they had gotten out in time.â
The four-story building at  Bolivar St. on the corner of Chimalpopoca â which became known in the news and on social media just as Chimalpopoca â had converted within seconds into a pile of concrete rubble. Neighbors and volunteers arrived on the scene  hoping to rescue those trapped within  but they lacked basic tools. At first   SÃ¡nchez  was immobilized by his concern for his family  but talking with other relatives  he snapped to. He couldnât dig into the concrete due to a previous injury  so he started mobilizing help via social networks  publishing lists of items that the volunteers needed â flood lights  cranes  power cutters â long before official rescue workers arrived on the site.
The day went on  and  SÃ¡nchez  still had no news of  his  mother and sister. Close to midnight  another of  his  sisters showed  him  blurry cellphone photos of bodies in a local morgue. Police had refused to let  his  sister inside  but offered to take photos of the bodies that had come in. She didnât recognize any of them  but  SÃ¡nchez  did.  He  lived with  his  mother  and that morning   he  had helped fasten her watch on her wrist before she took the subway to work â and  he  saw the watch in the photos from the morgue. When  he  went to claim the body   he  wiped the dust that covered  his  motherâs face  closed her eyes  and hugged her for the last time.
âMy heart was shredded to pieces â said  SÃ¡nchez . âI never imagined that she would die like this.â
Mexicoâs Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare has confirmed that the Chimalpopoca building contained five different companies  including SEO Young  the textile company where the SÃ¡nchez women worked. SEO Young also runs workshops in a building about a block away  at  Isabel La CatÃ³lica.  Fernando SÃ¡nchez  told The Intercept that  his  mother and sister had previously been at the location on Isabel La CatÃ³lica but switched to Chimalpopoca because the company told them the building was not structurally sound.
âThat building is standing  and they switched to one that collapsed â  SÃ¡nchez  said  shaking his head.
âWho authorized them to place that antenna and the electric substation there?â asked  SÃ¡nchez . âI am convinced that they caused the building to collapse.â Various Mexican media outlets have reported that the antenna weighed over  tons  based on an estimation given by one of the rescue workers who removed it with a crane.
According to the Mexican government   people died in the collapse at Chimalpopoca. Along with SÃ¡nchezâs mother and sister  other employees for SEO Young also died  including a mother and her daughter-in-law and a young woman who had just returned from pregnancy leave.  SÃ¡nchez  says that SEO Young offered $  in total for all the families of the deceased.
âI donât want to put a price on the life of my mother  but that is not a dignified amount â it is actually offensive â said  SÃ¡nchez .  He  refused to accept the money and says  he  will demand just compensation through legal means. Immediately   he  faces the cost of two funerals  about $ . The government has promised to reimburse various fees related to the earthquake  but the process had been slow.

Life in  Bars also grounds  Clapton 's drive in an early childhood trauma: His mother left him to be raised by his grandparents  a rejection that would haunt his subsequent romantic difficulties and decades-long struggles with substance addiction. The documentary is relatively low on talking heads  preferring voiceover narration from  Clapton  or old video footage: Cream wreaking havoc during a live performance in the U.S.; home-movie footage of the musician and his friends goofing around during the recording sessions for what would become Derek and the Dominos' one hit album;  Clapton  struggling to maintain equilibrium during a drunken show in the ; and then playing songs from  his  triumphant  Grammy-winning MTV Unplugged album in the .
It's  Clapton 's steadfast interest in the blues  however  that serves as the film's through-line. ""When it came to blues  there was no one like him "" says Mayall. And the doc  which makes its broadcast premiere on Showtime on February   makes a strong case for why that music has kept him going through highs  lows  good times and some seriously bad times. Here are  more takeaways from the movie.
 Clapton  was raised by his grandparents and ""was a bit of a loner at times "" says his grandma. But he found solace in the BBC children's show Uncle Mac. ""Uncle Mac was on the radio Saturday morning  and he would play a variety of music for kids ""  Clapton  remembers. ""And then every now and then  he'd play some different music: . You didn't hear that anywhere else. And I thought  this is for me â¦ it took all the pain away.""
But it brought some pain to those around him when he bought a guitar and practiced at home at all hours. ""I used to suffer agony at night ""  Clapton 's grandmother remembers. ""Three in the morning  he'd be up playing Big Bill Broonzy.""
In    Clapton  played a Christmas event with the Yardbirds. The Beatles were also on the bill  and seeing them had a profound effect on  Clapton . ""When the Beatles came on   would just start screaming so you couldn't hear anything "" he explains. ""We would watch from the wings and I could see how pointless these guys thought it was already. George was clearly an innovator. But the sad part was that no one listened.""
He thought he was safe in his band â which turned out not to be the case. ""I thought the Yardbirds had a real understanding about what it was all about  and it wasn't about being famous or getting on TV or having a hit "" he says. But then came ""For Your Love "" a hit for the group in . ""It was pop!""  Clapton  exclaims. ""All the material that we were doing was blues music that hadn't even filtered through to the mainstream yet. We were pioneering something. I noticed they were deliberately growing Beatles' haircuts. I thought  we sold out. I've sold out  I gotta get out of here."" He left the group high and dry with a major hit to promote and no lead guitarist to play it.
.  Clapton 's influences extend outside of guitarists.
Though he's known for six-string wizardry   Clapton  looked to other instruments for inspiration. ""I listened to  Bismillah Khan a lot "" he says. ""I wanted my guitar to sound like his reed instrument. One of the biggest influences on what I wanted to achieve with the guitar was Little Walter  the sound he made with the harmonica playing through an amplifier. It was thick and fat and very melodic.""
When  Clapton  went into the studio to record as a member of John Mayall's group  he was frustrated by technicians ""that just came up to your amp with the microphone and just stuck it two inches away from the front of the amplifier "" he says. ""It seemed to me that if you wanted to get the atmosphere we were getting in the clubs  you needed it to sound like you were in the audience  feet away  not three inches.""
 Clapton  moved the mics â and aspiring musicians took notice. ""That changed everything "" Roger Waters says. ""Before Eric  guitar playing in England had been Hank Marvin of the Shadows  very simple  not much technique. Suddenly we heard something completely different. The records sounded unlike anything we had heard before.""
Clapton and his new band went to Miami to record Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs  working in the legendary Criterion Studios with the Atlantic engineer Tom Dowd. But despite a talented group and sunny weather  ""two weeks into the session  we got stuck ""  Clapton  says. ""We hit a brick wall.""
Dowd took the outfit to see the Allman Brothers  and the performance had a galvanizing effect. ""I was completely blown away by this band ""  Clapton  remembers.  He  also struck up a friendship with Allman  who joined  Clapton  and co. in the studio. "" He  was the catalyst we needed ""  Clapton  adds.

Turnbullâs center-right coalition is now in a precarious position. His Liberal Party is the senior party in a coalition with the smaller National Party  which  Joyce  led.
The opposition Labor Party immediately went on the attack and threatened to launch a legal challenge to every decision made by  Joyce  since last yearâs election.
 Joyce  was one of a group of lawmakers  known as the âCitizenship Sevenâ  whose eligibility to sit in parliament was thrown into doubt in recent months when it was found they were dual citizens  a status that is barred for politicians under Australiaâs constitution to prevent split allegiances. 
Turnbull is under added pressure because he refused to force  Joyce  to step aside while his case was considered by the High Court.  Joyce   whose New England electorate is in rural New South Wales state  renounced  his  dual New Zealand citizenship in August.

 Joyce  confirmed  he  would stand in the by-election  which polling shows  he  has a strong chance of winning.
âIt is a tough game  politics â  Joyce  told reporters in the rural town of Tamworth in  his  electorate. âYou take the hits and the sacrifices.â

3861,dev,"Reviews The New Testament: A Translation By David Bentley Hart Yale University Press
In the beginning was â¦ well  what? A clap of the divine hands and a poetic shock wave? Or an itchy node of nothingness inconceivably scratching itself into somethingness? In the beginning was the Word  says the Gospel according to Johnâa lovely statement of the case  as itâs always seemed to me. A pre-temporal syllable swelling to utterance in the mouth of the universe  spoken once and heard forever: Godâs power chord  if you like. For  David Bentley Hart   however  whose mind-bending translation of the New Testament was published in October  the Wordâas a wordâdoes not suffice:  He  finds it to be âa curiously bland and impenetrable designationâ for the heady concept expressed in the original Greek of the Gospels as Logos. The Chinese word Tao might get at it   Hart  tells us  but English has nothing with quite the metaphysical flavor of Logos  the particular sense of a formative moral energy diffusing itself  without diminution  through space and time. So  he  throws up  his  hands and leaves it where it is: âIn the origin there was the Logos â¦â
Itâs significant  this act of lexical surrender  because if youâd bet on anyone to come up with a fancy English word for Logos  itâd be  David Bentley Hart . Vocabulary is not  his  problem  unless you think  he  has too much of it. A scholar  theologian  and cultural commentator   Hart  is also a stylist; or rather  the prickly and slightly preening polemical exhibition that is  his  style is indivisible from  his  role as a scholarly and theologically oriented cultural commentator. Like G. K. Chesterton  he has one essential argument: that God is the foundation of our being and that every human life therefore has its beginning and its end in eternity. He rehearses this argument in numberless witty variations against whichever non-God ideology happens to slouch beneath his pen: materialism  scientism  consumerism  pornographism â¦ And he can sound a Chestertonian note. âMy chief purpose â he wrote in s The Experience of God  âis not to advise atheists on what I think they should believe; I want merely to make sure that they have a clear concept of what it is they claim not to believe.â
Letâs zoom in on Mark  the roughest and tersest of the Gospels. (Hippolytus of Rome  in the third century  called Mark âstump fingeredââpossibly a physical descriptor but more likely  I think  a comment on his prose.) Hereâs how Monsignor Ronald Knox handled Mark : in his  translation: âThen a leper came up to him  asking for his aid; he knelt at his feet and said  If it be thy will  thou hast power to make me clean. Jesus was moved with pity; he held out his hand and touched him  and said  It is my will; be thou made clean.â  Hart âs version: âAnd a leper comes to him  imploring him and falling to his knees  saying to him  âIf you wish it  you are able to cleanse me.â And  moved inwardly with compassion  he stretched out his hand and touched him  and says to him  âI wish it  be clean.â â Thereâs a stumbling  almost rustically blundering urgency to this  the verb tenses tripping over one another; beside it the Knox translation feels smoothed out  falsely archaized  too rhetorical. In  Hart  we can hear more clearly both the leperâs challengeâheal me!âand the quickness and intimacy of Jesusâs response.","['Reviews The New Testament: A Translation By David Bentley Hart Yale University Press', 'In the beginning was â\x80¦ well  what?

In    Ellsberg  leaked the Pentagon Papers to the press in the hope that they would help end the Vietnam War.  His  story is portrayed in the new film The Post. Originally broadcast Dec.   .
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies  in for Terry Gross.  Our next guest  Daniel Ellsberg   became one of the best-known opponents of the Vietnam War in  when  he  leaked a secret Defense Department study of the war that came to be known as the Pentagon Papers to the country's leading newspapers. That story is the basis for the new film ""The Post"" starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. In this scene  Washington Post editor Ben Bagdikian is meeting  Ellsberg   who's hiding out in a motel  eluding an FBI manhunt. Piles of papers are spread out over the two beds in the room. Matthew Rhys plays  Ellsberg . Bob Odenkirk plays Bagdikian.
MATTHEW RHYS: (As Daniel Ellsberg) Ben.
RHYS: (As Daniel Ellsberg) The study had  volumes. I slipped out a couple at a time - took me months to copy it all.
RHYS: (As Daniel Ellsberg) Well  we were all former government guys - top clearance - all that. McNamara wanted academics to have the chance to examine what had happened. He would say to us  let the chips fall where they may.
RHYS: (As Daniel Ellsberg) Well  I think guilt was a bigger motivator than courage. McNamara lies as well as the rest  but I don't think he saw what was coming  what we'd find. But it didn't take him long to figure out - well  for us all to figure out. If the public ever saw these papers  they would turn against the war. Covert ops  guaranteed debt  rigged elections - it's all in there. Ike  Kennedy  Johnson. They violated the Geneva Convention. They lied to Congress  and they lied to the public. They knew we couldn't win and still sent boys to die.
DAVIES:  Daniel Ellsberg   now   has a new book about  his  days before the Vietnam War when  he  worked on American nuclear war strategies in the late ' and early '.  Ellsberg  was appalled by much of what  he  found and wishes  he 'd been able to leak those plans along with the Pentagon Papers.  His  book is called ""The Doomsday Machine.""
DAVIES: Well   Daniel Ellsberg   welcome to FRESH AIR. You became famous for leaking the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times and other publications. And you tell us at the beginning of this book that you copied not just the Vietnam study but a lot of other material from your safe at the RAND Corporation about U.S. nuclear war plans. What were you going to do with that material?
DAVIES: My guest is  Daniel Ellsberg .  His  new book is ""The Doomsday Machine."" We'll continue our conversation after just a short break. This is FRESH AIR.

He  has a new book called ""The Doomsday Machine: Confessions Of A Nuclear War Planner"" about  his  early days doing nuclear war planning for the Air Force.
 ELLSBERG : Pardon me. I think I'm going to make it clear  but I wouldn't even want the question - to raise that question  in a way. I am a patriot  and that has never changed.
 ELLSBERG : Without young men going to prison for nonviolent protests against the draft  men that I met on their way to prison  no Pentagon Papers. It wouldn't have occurred to  me  simply to do something that would put  myself  in prison for the rest of my life  as I assumed that would do.

 ELLSBERG : Well  in those days  it was one page at a time. We didn't have these zip  zip  multi-page collators and whatnot machines that they have now or the - of course  the digital capability. So it took me a long time - months  actually.
 ELLSBERG : Yes.

3864,dev,"ATLANTA â Landon Collins  wants  his  troubled teammate back  but prefers to pass on the legendary head coach.
The Giantsâ Pro Bowl safety  in attendance for Monday nightâs national championship game between Alabama   his  alma mater  and Georgia  voiced support for maligned cornerback Eli Apple.  He   however  doesnât want to see Patriots coach Bill Belichick return to East Rutherford as had been rumored as a possibility in the wake of an ESPN story that detailed friction among Belichick  quarterback Tom Brady and owner Robert Kraft.
âMy relationship can be repaired with  him  â  Collins  said of Apple  with whom  he  feuded through the media this season. âOur relationship can be mended. I donât know what  his  mindset is right now.  He âs kind of all over the place right now. You can see that with  his  Twitter rant. We got to have an understanding why  he âs playing football  because you got to be playing football to be one of the best players  not to be on the team and blowing your opportunity.â
Apple struggled mightily in his second season  appearing in only  games. He was inactive for a four-game stretch late in the year and suspended for the final game of the season. He clashed with Collins  who called him a âcancerâ after Apple indirectly called  Collins  a liar when the safety said he was trying to help him through his struggles. Apple has recently been spending time on Twitter going at critical Giants fans.
 Collins  told The Post  he  and Apple havenât spoken since having a sit-down with interim coach Steve Spagnuolo the final week of the regular season  and wouldnât say whether either apologized to the other  wanting to keep the conversation private. But  he  plans to reach out to  him  soon  and spend time with  him  in the offseason.  He  believes Apple will be back with the Giants despite the myriad issues  he  dealt with and created this season.
âI think the organization should keep  him  â  Collins  said. â He âs a first-rounder.  He  does a good job when  his  head is on straight on the field. â¦ I want  him  to be here. I want  him  to be under my wing  and I can continue pushing  him   continuing teaching  him  how this game is and how this business goes  and help  him  grow up as much as I can.â
As for Belichick  the five-time Super Bowl-winning coach who said on Monday  he  âabsolutelyâ plans to stay with the Patriots   Collins  said Belichick is too similar to  his  college coach  Nick Saban  for his taste. He credited Sabanâs rigid style with getting him to the NFL  but itâs not something he wants to live through again.
âThe way he runs his organization  Iâve been through that process. I donât like it â  Collins  said. âItâs too strict. â¦. Heâs a great winner  heâs a great coach. I donât know if  is what the organization really wants.
 Collins  doesnât have a specific choice for whom  he  wants the Giants to hire.  He  has yet to meet with new general manager Dave Gettleman  but plans to do so this week once  he  returns to New Jersey.  He âs been impressed so far by the new boss  who fired vice president of player evaluation Marc Ross and cut right tackle Bobby Hart the day before the regular-season finale.
â He âs sticking to  his  word  what  his  words were? âKicking ass ââ  Collins  said. âIâm happy about that. I like that  he âs enforcing what  he  said  he  was going to do.

3865,dev,"Lou Anna Simon   who had been credited with building the public university into a formidable academic center  bolstered by fundraising and research prowess  stepped down Wednesday in the face of a wave of public outrage.
 Simon  said  she  had planned to retire in   but postponed  her  departure after learning of allegations about Nassar  a former team USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November to sexual assault. In a statement released Wednesday night   she  spoke directly to survivors  who have challenged  her  in harrowing testimony in recent days.
""To the survivors  I can never say enough that I am so sorry that a trusted  renowned physician was really such an evil  evil person who inflicted such harm under the guise of medical treatment   Simon  says. ""I know that we all share the same resolve to do whatever it takes to avert such tragedies here and elsewhere . . . The survivors' accounts are horrific. They are tragic  heartbreaking  and personally gut-wrenching.""
Brian Breslin  chairman of the school's board of trustees  said Wednesday evening the board would accept  Simon 's resignation.
""We agree with  Dr. Simon  that it is now time for change "" Breslin said. "" President Simon  has served with distinction as MSU's president for  years and has been a constant presence at the university for more than  years.  She  literally has devoted  her  entire professional life to this institution  and more than anyone else has helped make MSU a national and international leader in higher education.""
 Simon 's success as a leader had earned  her  support from the board of trustees  most of whom stood by  her  during the Nassar scandal  and from many faculty members  who cautioned against a rush to judgment in the court of public opinion.
On Wednesday evening  both U.S. senators from Michigan  Debbie Stabenow  D  and Gary Peters  D  called for  Simon 's resignation. ""It has become clear that the leadership at Michigan State University has failed to adequately prevent  address or respond to the victimization of young women and girls on its campus  and the crisis at MSU continues despite today's verdict "" Peters wrote in a statement.
Michigan's state House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a measure Wednesday calling for  Simon 's removal. State Rep. Adam Zemke  D-Ann Arbor  said  Simon  was responsible ""for perpetuating a sick culture that allowed a predator to continue molesting new young women and girls while also forcing  his  past victims to endure their suffering in silence. Her blatant failure to protect students from Nassar's abuse proves that she is unfit to continue as president of the university . . .  Simon  must go.""
Hundreds of students had said they would march to the administration building Friday to demand  Simon 's resignation. Last week  a unanimous vote by the Associated Students of Michigan State University condemned the board of trustees and administration for their handling of sexual assault  saying the institution's leaders had failed them  and that change in leadership was necessary.
The student-body president  Lorenzo Santavicca  thanked  Simon  on Wednesday night for her tireless leadership  saying it was clear Michigan State had increased its global leadership  but that the institution needed to ""look outward  say we're sorry  and mean it."" He said university leaders need to empathize and ask how to move forward  and that a smooth transition will be crucial  with a new president assuring the campus community of an ability to listen.
Some professors had defended  Simon   saying  she  was well-respected at the university  that  she  could not have been expected to have known about the abuses  and that they trusted  her  to implement changes needed to ensure a safe and respectful environment on campus in the future.
 Simon  is a Spartan to the core  several faculty members said:  She  earned  her  doctorate at Michigan State in  and held a variety of positions at the university  including provost  before being named president in .
 Simon  said in  her  resignation letter  she  limited  her  personal remarks to keep the focus on ""Team MSU "" but finished with an intimate farewell.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Saudi Arabiaâs King Salman for talks at the Kremlin on Thursday  cementing a relationship that is pivotal for world oil prices and could decide the outcome of the conflict in Syria.
 King Salman  the first sitting Saudi monarch ever to visit Russia   led a delegation to Moscow that agreed joint investment deals worth several billion dollars  providing much-needed investment for a Russian economy battered by low oil prices and Western sanctions.
On his journey into central Moscow from Vnukovo airport late on Wednesday   King Salmanâs limousine  passed billboards bearing  his  photograph and messages in Russian and Arabic welcoming  him .
âI am sure that your visit will provide a good impulse for the development of relations between our two states â Putin told  King Salman  later as they sat alongside each other in the Kremlinâs lavishly-decorated Green Parlour.
 The Saudi king  invited Putin to visit  his  country - an offer the Russian leader accepted - and said they planned to keep cooperating to keep world oil prices stable.

3868,dev,"Last weekâs CNN town hall on gun violence featured strong calls for action from survivors of the Parkland shooting  a combative NRA spokesperson  and a nervous Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). It did not feature Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student   Colton Haab   who had been set to attend the town hall.
The reason why  Haab  wasnât there  according to what  Haab  told media in the days after the town hall  was because CNN tried to tell  him  what to say. But this argument fell apart on Tuesday after Haabâs father Glenn admitted he had doctored an email exchange with CNN which made it look as though CNN was directing what Colton could say at the town hall. This caused even Fox News to admit  grudgingly  that the Haabsâ initial claims were suspect and there was no evidence CNN tried to give him a scripted question.
 Colton Haab  was reportedly one of several JROTC students who helped protect dozens of classmates by hiding them in a JROTC classroom.  He  spoke about this to outlets such as Fox & Friends  and advocated arming trained teachers in schools.
CNN reached out to  Haab  about participating in the town hall  but  he  told the local ABC affiliate the day of the event that  he  refused to attend because âCNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions and it ended up being all scripted.â  He  showed two pieces of paper with the speech  he  had initially emailed to CNN  along with several questions.
 Haab  went on Tucker Carlsonâs Fox News program the following evening  and said first someone from CNN asked for a speech  and then asked for âmore questionsâ which  Haab  said  he  was fine with. Then  he  told Carlson  the day of the event  CNN âhad taken what I had wrote  and what I had briefed on and talked about  and they actually wrote the question for  me .â  He  said  he  believed that CNN had supplied other students who participated in the event with questions  and that  he  found the whole thing âshockingâ and âupsetting.â
On Tuesday  Haabâs father  who had helped facilitate his sonâs communications with CNN  admitted that he had doctored an email sent to media to push the claim that CNN had told  Colton  what to say. He said he omitted some words  but did not do it on purpose  according to the AP. Both versions of the exchange have CNN asking Glenn Haab to make  Colton âs questions shorter âso that we can get to as many people as possible.â Then the key sentence: âThis is what  Colton  and I discussed on the phone that he submitted.â The version of the exchange  Glenn Colton  circulated to media after the event omitted the words âthat he submitted.â
Though  Glenn Colton  said  he  did not omit the words on purpose and âthere was nothing malicious behind it â the omission changed the basis of the conservative mediaâs freakout enough that  even Foxâs Tucker Carlson  who had Colton Haab on his show the day after the town hall to make these claims  issued a brief correction on his Tuesday show.
  Carlson  reviewed the story  said that CNN and the Haabs had shared the differing emails with Fox the day after the Haab interview  and that the Haabs âsaid they were being slandered by CNN and that is where it stood  two sides telling contradictory storiesâ¦â

Previous majorities had threatened to upend filibuster rules in this manner  but relying on a simple majority vote had been used only for relatively minor procedural changes to how amendments were handled  never to eliminate the superÂ­majority requirement altogether. Before Thursday  the standard precedent was that major rule changes needed a two-thirds majority. The change was so significant that  Reid  and  his  leadership team held a victory party with liberal activists afterward in a room just off the Senate floor.
After the vote   Reid  told reporters that  his  views on the issue had evolved â from eight years ago  when Republicans held the majority and  he  led the fight to protect the filibuster.  He  acknowledged that  he  wouldnât mind seeing the supermajority requirement abolished for everything but that there were not enough votes in  his  caucus to support such a move.
 Reid  first faced pressure on this issue from junior Democrats four years ago  particularly Sen. Jeff Merkley  a former speaker of the Oregon state House  who became the point person for growing the anti-filibuster movement. But  Reid  repeatedly rejected their effort as too radical.
Even if Republicans want to do away with the filibuster someday   Reid  said  Thursdayâs move was worth it because the current climate had become too hostile to get anything significant done.

Pragerâs comments came in response to  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerâs (D-NY ) opposition to a federal judicial nominee on the basis of the nominee being white.
 Schumer  further advocated for the implementation of racial and ethnic quotas within federal judicial nominations. Merit should be subverted in pursuit of âdiversity â  he  suggested  calling for the nomination of more female and ânon-whiteâ nominees on the basis of sex  race  and ethnicity. The federal judiciary should â looking a lot more like the America it represents â said  Schumer  during a Wednesday Senate session:
The nomination of Marvin Quattlebaum speaks to the overall lack of diversity in President Trumpâs selection for the Federal judiciary. Mr. Quattlebaum replaces not one but two scuttled Obama nominees who were African American. As of February    percent of  President Trumpâs  confirmed nominees were male;  percent were White. That represents the lowest share of non-White candidates in three decades. It is long past time that the judiciary starts looking a lot more like the America it represents. Having a diversity of views and experience on the Federal bench is necessary for the equal administration of justice. After years of improvement  the Trump administration  as in so many other areas  is taking a giant step backwardâthis time  when it comes to the diversity of their nominations. I will be voting no on the Quattlebaum nomination.
Following  Schumerâs  quota-based logic  Prager asked if the share of Jews within the judiciary should be reduced in pursuit of proportionate ethnic representation:
I wonder  if  thinks  should look like America â Iâm just curious  since Iâm a Jew  I can ask this question  because if a non-Jew asked this heâd be accused of anti-Semitism â so I would like to know  Iâll bet you that the proportion of judges who are Jewish is greater than the proportion of Jews in the society. Would  Chuck Schumer  like to see fewer Jews in the judiciary so that the judiciary looked like the American population? Is that an unfair question? Iâm serious  is it unfair? If heâs serious about what he said  does he think Asians overrepresent? Does he feel this way about sports?","['â\x80\x9cWould  Chuck Schumer  like to see fewer Jews in the judiciary so that the judiciary looked like the American population?â\x80\x9d asked Dennis Prager on Fridayâ\x80\x99s edition of his eponymous radio show.', 'Pragerâ\x80\x99s comments came in response to  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerâ\x80\x99s (D-NY ) opposition to a federal judicial nominee on the basis of the nominee being white.', ' Schumer  further advocated for the implementation of racial and ethnic quotas within federal judicial nominations.

3873,dev,"Two minutes into a conversation at Gila River Arena   Coyotes defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson  sounded as if  he  misses the Blackhawks as much as  his  former team clearly misses  him .
âI grew up there ââ  Hjalmarsson  said of  his   seasons with the Hawks. âAs a kid in the minors  my first organization. â¦ The city was special to me  and the guys I played with for such a long time  Iâll be connected with my whole life. There are a lot of fun reunions Iâm looking forward to.ââ
On the day of the NHL draft last June  Hawks general manager Stan Bowman overreacted to his vow for change by trading  Hjalmarsson  to the Coyotes for younger and more affordable defenseman Connor Murphy  who has been a disappointment.
One of only seven Hawks to have his name engraved on three Stanley Cups   Hjalmarsson  left town regarded as one of the top defensemen in team history â yet was considered expendable at . The fact that veteran Duncan Keith has been the only Hawks defenseman who hasnât been a healthy scratch this season says everything about the inconsistency at the position.
Those persistent problems underscore why trading  Hjalmarsson  upset Hawks coach Joel Quenneville enough for him to walk out of an NHL coaches meeting last summer after he was told.  Hjalmarsson  learned about the trade at home in Sweden  where  it  took awhile for the news to register.
âI didnât see it coming ââ  Hjalmarsson  said. âI felt like I had a decent regular season  but obviously our playoff run was embarrassing. Every year with the salary-cap situation in Chicago  a couple guys always move  so it was my turn â even if I wasnât prepared for it.ââ
Seven months later   Hjalmarsson  says  he  has yet to talk to Bowman about the deal but holds no bitterness.  He  even roots for the Hawks to make the playoffs.  He  didnât develop a reputation as one of the toughest guys in the league  pound for pound  because  his  ego bruises easily.
âIt doesnât bother me  and weâll talk sometime in the future ââ  Hjalmarsson  said. âI understand itâs a business. In this league  you have to separate that and try to see it Stanâs way and what  he âs trying to do for the team.  His  opinion was  he  was trying to make the team better  and I have to accept that.ââ
 Hjalmarsson  smiled.
âInstead of being pissed off about it  Iâm trying to look back and be extremely proud of what I did in Chicago and thankful for the fans there ââ  he  said.
In Arizona  fewer fans care about hockey and fall short of creating the atmosphere  Hjalmarsson  experienced at the United Center. The anthem before Tuesday nightâs matchup against the Sharks  which ended in a - shootout loss  came before a crowd of only   in a building that lacked buzz. No NHL team has fewer than the Coyotesâ  victories and  in this market  nobody seems terribly bothered about it.
The Coyotes hoped  Hjalmarsson  would help establish a winning culture  one of the reasons they made him an alternate captain. He welcomes the responsibility.
âWe had a lot of leaders in Chicago  but obviously I have a bigger role here with such a young team  so I want to show consistency on the ice with how Iâm playing and off the ice with how Iâm preparing and taking care of my body ââ  Hjalmarsson  said.
Injuries have slowed  Hjalmarssonâs  adjustment  causing  him  to miss  games already after missing just  over  his  last eight seasons with the Hawks. The first upper-body injury occurred Oct.  against the Flyers  and a second one happened Nov.  against the Oilers  knocking  him  out the entire month of December.
âItâs been a little frustrating obviously because you want to put your best foot forward and prove the organization right ââ  Hjalmarsson  said.
Some things never change: Despite limited action  the player known as âHammerâ still ranks among the leagueâs top  in blocked shots per game  average ..

 Betsy DeVos  displayed at best confusion and at worst a lack of knowledge about a key federal law involving students with disabilities during  her  Tuesday confirmation hearing before a Senate panel that will vote on whether  she  should become President-elect Donald Trumpâs education secretary.
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) asked  DeVos  about the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)  which requires public schools to provide children with disabilities a âfree appropriate public educationâ and governs how states and public agencies provide various services to millions of students.
Kaine asked  her  if  she  believes that all schools that receive federal funding â whether public  public charter or private â should be required to meet the requirements of IDEA.
 She  responded: âI think they already are.â
 DeVos  said: âI think that is a matter that is best left to the states.â
 Devos  repeated: âI think thatâs an issue thatâs best left to the states.â
 DeVos  began speaking about a Florida voucher program for students with disabilities that requires students to sign away their IDEA due process rights.
 DeVos  said: âI think that is certainly worth discussion.â

Near the end of the hearing  Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) returned to the issue  telling  DeVos  that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and noting that federal law must be followed.  She  asked  DeVos  if  she  stood by  her  statement that it was up to the states to follow it  and  DeVos  responded  âFederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.â
 DeVos  responded  âI may have confused it.â
( DeVos  may have confused IDEA? With what  exactly?)
Hassan then explained to  DeVos  what IDEA actually guarantees to students with disabilities  and urged her to learn about it  saying she was âconcernedâ that  DeVos  was unfamiliar with it.

3888,dev,"While Trump once supported abortion  he has since reversed his position  saying in his first interview after winning the election that he wants to appoint ""pro-life"" judges with the goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. His highly conservative nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat  Neil Gorsuch  is expected to try to carry out this mission.
Roe would likely fall in one of two ways  according to Dawn Johnsen  a constitutional scholar from Indiana University and the legal director of NARAL Pro-Choice America from  to .
The most drastic way the court could get rid of  Roe  would be to overturn the case. The more likely scenario  however  would see the court letting  Roe  stand but incrementally upholding laws that restrict access  making abortions impossible to get â rendering the procedure virtually illegal over time.
Glenn Cohen  a health-law expert and professor at Harvard Law School  said two kinds of laws provide the most likely paths for SCOTUS to overturn or undermine Roe.
The gradual erosion of Roe v. Wade is a much more likely scenario for diminishing abortion access  according to Cohen  because Chief Justice John Roberts often plays the ""long game."" Roberts hasn't explicitly come out against  Roe  or abortion (as is tradition with justices)  but he has said he respects the precedence of  Roe  yet supported abortion restrictions in Supreme Court cases while on the bench.
What would happen if  Roe  were overturned?
If  Roe  fell   states have laws on the books banning abortion  so the practice would be illegal there immediately. Other states would likely act quickly to pass similar ""trigger"" laws.
That would likely become even more apparent if Roe fell.
How likely is it that  Roe  will be overturned?
Toti said she doesn't think  Roe  is in ""any immediate jeopardy "" largely because both the Supreme Court and a majority of Americans support abortion.
Pew Research Center polls have found that % of US adults today support the legality of abortion in general and % want the Supreme Court to uphold Roe â both numbers that have risen over time.
Even if the Senate approves Gorsuch's nomination  Toti said  the court will likely still have a - majority that would uphold Roe.
It will likely be some time before Gorsuch can actively participate in cases  as well. Toti estimated that the lengthy Senate approval process will sideline the new justice from deciding on cases until at least October . And even if Gorsuch is aggressively anti-Roe  Trump would still need another justice to retire or die to shift the balance  an unlikely scenario in the next four years.
Not everyone is as optimistic as Toti. If Trump is elected for a second term  the chances of him choosing another justice go up â as do the chances of  Roe  falling.
""I am very pessimistic about it  and that's because I'm thinking about the range of ways  Roe  can fall that would not require the Supreme Court to actually say  'We are overruling  Roe v. Wade  '"" Johnsen said. ""We've seen the kinds of laws that would shut clinics  and ban abortions for reasons  and force women to be interrogated by their doctors â and that all could be upheld without the Supreme Court actually saying  'We're overruling  Roe v. Wade .'""
Erica Sackin  director of political communications for Planned Parenthood  told Business Insider that the healthcare provider is ""absolutely gearing up for a huge fight "" and that the wave of donations they received underline how many people support upholding Roe â including those who voted for Trump.","['While Trump once supported abortion  he has since reversed his position  saying in his first interview after winning the election that he wants to appoint ""pro-life"" judges with the goal of overturning Roe v.

As executive producer of the six-minute film   Bryant  accepted  his  golden Oscar statue from ""Star Wars"" star Mark Hamill on Sunday night.  He  shared the award with Disney animator Glen Keane.

Since hanging up his basketball shoes   Bryant  has delved into business (a new Nike shoe) and various forms of storytelling.
The -year-old sports superstar believed the nomination validated that  he  could succeed off the court.

The scene had played out  times previously this season  but this one was special. This one featured  Zach LaVine  right in the middle of it.
Capping a journey that began  months ago when  he  suffered a torn ACL in  his  left knee while playing for the Timberwolves   LaVine  made  his  season debut during the Bullsâ - victory over the Pistons. Trading in street clothes for  his  home red Bulls uniform   LaVine  was the last of the five Bulls starters introduced to the delight of the   in attendance.

It didnât take long for  LaVine  to use  his  paws in a positive way  as  he  drained  his  first shot as a Bull â a -pointer â  seconds into the game.  LaVine   who is on a -minute limit for at least the next week  finished with  points and two assists in  minutes.

For a Bulls team that entered Saturday with a - record since Dec.    LaVineâs  debut sent a surge of excitement throughout the group.
âItâs the last hurdle to clear for  Zach  in this process â Hoiberg said. âFor him finally to get out there and get this behind him I know is very important.â
âWe put this system in place with  Zach  in mind â Hoiberg said. âIt happened to fit some of the other guys with our spacing fours  with playing some lineups where we had two spacing front-line players out here. But to have wings that can get out and run in transition is a very big part of what we put in place and also having guys who can come off hand-offs and rise up and shoot the ball.

âThis offseason  I worked really hard on defense because I want to be better than last year ââ  Sanchez  said through a translator Tuesday at George M. Steinbrenner Field. âI want to fix all the little issues I had last year defensively and keep improving.â
Those issues included allowing as many passed balls () as any catcher in baseball  as well as the second most wild pitches (). Those numbers improved in the second half  but they led former manager Joe Girardi to bench and publicly criticize  Sanchez .
With Aaron Boone in charge   Sanchez  said  he  holds no grudge against Girardi.
âLooking back at all the things Girardi said  I feel all that stuff he said was to make me be better ââ  Sanchez  said. âAt the end of the year  I thought he helped me get better. Itâs tough to go through  but you have to learn from that and keep getting better. You also have to move on.â
 Sanchez  missed much of the early part of last season with a strained biceps  and when  he  returned   he  was a force again at the plate.
While  he  couldnât duplicate the historic numbers  he  put up when  he  hit  homers in  plate appearances in  his  breakout rookie season   Sanchez  hit  homers in  his  first full season in the majors.
âItâs a great acquisition ââ  Sanchez  said of Stantonâs arrival from Miami. âItâs a big powerful bat in a lineup thatâs gonna contribute a lot. â¦ It caught me by surprise when I heard the news .â
âWeâll try to do what we did last year ââ  Sanchez  said. âThereâs definitely motivation whenever you get to be a part of a playoff run and be part of that atmosphere.

3912,dev,"Trump 's attempt to make a surprise visit to the Korean demilitarized zone ahead of a speech to the South Korean National Assembly was foiled by bad weather â apparently the moderately thick haze that has covered the sky here this week. Secret Service agents made the call minutes after Marine One had taken off  forcing  Trump  to return to Seoul and abort the -mile flight north. After waiting another hour for the skies to clear  the White House canceled the visit to the heavily watched border region that has divided North and South since the halt of the Korean War in .
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that  Trump  was scheduled to tour the DMZ with South Korean President Moon Jae-in  which would have marked the first-ever joint visit.
""He's actually pretty frustrated "" she said of  Trump . Asked how long the trip had been in the works  she said it had been planned ""for a little while "" since before  Trump  left on  his  Asia trip last Friday. It was ""something the president wanted to do "" she said.
Last week  White House officials had ruled out a DMZ visit  saying it was becoming âa clicheâ and noting that Vice President Pence  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had each visited this year. After arriving in South Korea on Tuesday   Trump  toured Camp Humphreys  a joint U.S.-South Korean military base about  miles south of Seoul  where he ate lunch with troops and was briefed by commanders.
Aides said  Trump   in  his  speech to the Korean parliament  will lay out a broad strategy to increase international pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile programs.  Trump  asserted Tuesday that  his  administration is making âa lot of progressâ on North Korea  and  he  urged Kim to âmake a dealâ at the negotiating table.
âI believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing  not only for North Korea but for humanity all over the world â  Trump  said during a news conference with Moon after a meeting at the Blue House.
âI do see certain movement  yes  but weâll see what happens â  he  added  without offering any details.
The DMZ visit was not announced publicly. The traveling press pool that accompanies  Trump  was summoned earlier than expected. Sanders met the group with a sign on which the letters âDMZâ were written and told them that is how she was instructed to inform them of the trip. She explained that the reporters were not permitted to make details public until after the president had visited the DMZ and returned to Seoul  presumably out of security concerns.
According to a pool reporter  the group boarded Chinook helicopters along with a half-dozen men in camouflage-patterned tactical gear. The helicopters traveled about  minutes before turning around.  Trump  does have a motorcade available in Seoul but taking the trip by ground would have taken longer and foiled the element of surprise; it also would have been difficult to shut down and secure crowded Seoul streets at a moment's notice.
South Koreaâs government had been opposed to Trumpâs plan to visit the DMZ  viewing it as unnecessarily confrontational at a time of heightened rhetoric between  Trump  and Kim  according to numerous reports ahead of the U.S. presidentâs visit to Seoul.
But  Trump  reportedly informed Moon during their summit talks Tuesday that  he  planned to go ahead with the visit  leaving the South Korean president with little choice but to agree. Moon was waiting for  Trump  at a guard post inside the DMZ  having arrived there earlier in the morning.
Kim Sung-han  a former vice foreign minister  said the fact that  Trump  didn't make it to the DMZ avoided unnecessarily raising tension.
""One of South Korea's goals of this summit was to lower the tensions caused by the war of harsh words between the U.S. and North Korea "" Kim said. ""Had  President Trump  made provocative remarks at the DMZ  it could have created a very serious situation.""
For that reason -- and contrary to the Blue House's official insistence otherwise -- the Moon government had been trying to steer  Trump  away from the DMZ  Kim said.
But Robert Kelly  a professor of international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea  said that the fears of escalation at the DMZ were overblown  suggesting the trip was all about imagery for  Trump .
â The president  is a show man   he âs a reality TV star â Kelly said. âI think the idea of standing in the DMZ and making pronouncements about being strong against North Korea appeals to  his  sense of theatricality.""","[""Trump 's attempt to make a surprise visit to the Korean demilitarized zone ahead of a speech to the South Korean National Assembly was foiled by bad weather â\x80\x94 apparently the moderately thick haze that has covered the sky here this week.

3914,dev,"Rebecca Friedrichs  is an unsung hero who should be sung about a whole lot more.  She  is an Orange County public school teacher with  years of being an educator under  her  belt.  She  also  just last year  found  herself  facing off against one of the most powerful teacherâs unions in the United States  the California Teachers Association (CTA).
More amazingly   she  used to be one of the union leaders.
 Friedrichs  tried to affect change from within the CTA â who were buying off politicians that restricted competition  and charging teachers absurd membership fees â that caused schools to stagnate. But  Friedrichs  soon came to realize that only the voters and the courts can break the hold that the union had over the state of California.
âSadly  parents and educators no longer run our public schools because labor unions control way too much on our campuses today â  Friedrichs  told TheBlaze. âI understand why labor unions focus on getting more for their members; thatâs their business model  and getting more money and power for themselves is their value. Great teachers and parents donât share the unionsâ values or business model. We believe children should be first in our schools  and we believe educational excellence and safety should reign supreme.â
And due to her battle   Friedrichs  became something of an icon for school choice. This in turned grabbed the attention of the popular conservative site  Prager U.
Naturally  they chose  Friedrichs  to star in their first video discussing why good teachers support school choice  and how competition has been proven to work for schools  just like it works well for the free market.
This is a message  Friedrichs  wants to get across very clearly. Having had years of experience with children  sheâs gotten a pretty good idea about how they learn and grow. As she told us  the way public schools treat kids nowadays you would think they view the children as defective  and in need of drugging to make them ânormal.â
âI believe our current public education system is designed for those who can sit still and listen all day â  Friedrichs  told TheBlaze. âMany boys â and some girls â do not fit this category  so we often drug them and call them âdeficit â and âdisorder.â Iâve had hundreds of these little boys in my classes throughout my career â and one of them grew in my womb â and none of them seemed âdeficit â or âdisorderâ to me.â
With  Friedrichs  and Prager U teaming up  both are confident that school choice across the nation is an achievable goal.
âPrager U has a huge national following with a large percentage under  years old. As a public school educator and parent of children who attended public schools  Iâm well acquainted with a lot of the indoctrination going on in our schools today â talk about fake news!â  Friedrichs  told  us . âKnowing the Prager U messages are reaching the younger generations gives me hope many will learn the Judeo-Christian values our great country was founded upon  so  we  can restore truth and goodness in  our  culture.â","['Rebecca Friedrichs  is an unsung hero who should be sung about a whole lot more.

3920,dev,"TV reporter Lauren Sivan  discussed the details of the incident Monday morning in an appearance on NBC's ""Megyn Kelly Today."" Kelly opened the show by declaring ""He's out"" as pictures of Weinstein scrolled on the talk show set's LED screens.
 Sivan  has joined a growing list of accusers who have come forward since last Thursday when the New York Times published an extensive report detailing decades of allegations that the veteran movie mogul sexually harassed women  from actresses to secretaries and script readers. Weinstein was fired Sunday night from the company he co-founded with his brother  Bob Weinstein  in  as a result of the mushrooming scandal.
 Sivan  described the decade-old incident in which  she  met Weinstein at a party at a New York restaurant in which  he  was an investor. At the time  she  was an anchor for News  Long Island; at present  she  is an anchor for Fox O&O KTTV Los Angeles.
 Sivan  said Weinstein lured  her  to the restaurant's kitchen and tried to kiss  her . When  she  rebuffed that advance   he  allegedly blocked  her  passage in a narrow corridor while  he  masturbated  according to  Sivan .
""I just stood there dumbfounded ""  Sivan  said. ""I could not believe what I was witnessing.""  She  recalled thinking that  he  was ""disgusting and kind of pathetic."" The lengthy apology that Weinstein issued in a statement after the Times report hit was ""the last straw"" that made  Sivan  come forward with  her  story because  she  felt  he  showed ""no remorse.""
Kelly said at start of the interview that she has been friendly with  Sivan  for years  and she also noted that she has known Weinstein for some time. Last year  Kelly's disclosure that she endured sexual harassment from former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes helped speed the ouster of one of the most powerful figures in media.
 Sivan  told Kelly that after she rejected  his  kiss  Weinstein told her: ""Well then just stand there and be quiet."" Earlier in the evening at the party   Sivan  said  she 'd enjoyed a lively conversation with the famed producer about politics and presidential history  among other topics.  He  then invited  her  to take a tour of the restaurant's kitchen.
""The most demeaning part of it all was that  minutes earlier  he  was having this great conversation with  me  ""  she  said. ""I felt so great and flattered by it. And then to be told 'stand there and be quiet' negated any warm feelings.""
 Sivan  said  she  was shocked by ""the casualness"" of  his  actions. Amid  her  dismay   she  wondered if  she 'd managed to send  him  the wrong signal of  her  interest in  him .
""There's that feeling of shame  "" Sivan  said. ""Perhaps I did something to give  him  the wrong impression.""
 Sivan  said  she  decided not to go public with the story because  she  was in a long-term relationship with  her  boyfriend and didn't want to disrupt  her  life. ""I was lucky enough to never have to work with  again ""  she  said.

It follows on from âA History of the World in  Objectsâ  his groundbreaking -week-long series of radio stories that went out in . Now the BBC has started transmitting his reflections on religious culture in  new radio talks of  minutes each. The talks draw in part on âLiving with Godsâ  an exhibition at the British Museum that uses objects to portray the transcendent as it has been conceived throughout human history.
The oldest item  and the subject of  Mr MacGregor âs opening talk  is a mammoth-tusk sculpture called the Lion Man dating back to the Ice Age. Even among hunter-gatherers who were struggling to survive  it was worthwhile for someone to spend up to  hours fashioning an object that served nothing but a talismanic purpose  connecting people to invisible worlds. The newest object is a cross made by an Italian carpenter from bits of a ship that was carrying refugees when it foundered in the Mediterranean near Lampedusa (pictured). As part of his broadcast   Mr MacGregor  goes to the cave where the Lion Man was found and talks to a German scholar. With a remit to travel wherever he needs and speak to anyone who can help  his enquiries take him to  among other places  the Ganges river in India and the Stone Age tomb of Newgrange in Ireland.
Listeners are invited to follow his wanderings  to take jumps between cultures and historical eras and even to leap between the here-and-now and the transcendent. In the same few minutes   Mr MacGregor  describes a coat made from seal-gut by the Yupik people of Alaska and a figure of Osiris  an Egyptian deity that is connected with life  death and the underworld. The coat speaks of indigenous huntersâ sacramental relationship with their prey  the Osiris figure of the new life engendered by the Nile.
Jill Cook  who curated an important show at the British Museum in  that explained how the Ice Age made the modern mind  is also the curator of this new exhibition. She shares  Mr MacGregor âs desire to present religion as a social phenomenon that has been present in every age of history  cementing and expressing social bonds  and also violently dividing people. By including exhibits related to the communist cult of atheism  she shows that attempts to squeeze religion out of society have sometimes dramatically misfired: anti-religion can easily become a cult.
 Mr MacGregor  is a social anthropologist on a vast plane  whereas Ms Cook leans more to the neuroscience of religion. By including sounds  such as softly heard bells and flutes  she draws attention to the aural stimuli that can arouse peopleâs spiritual antennae.","['A prime mover in this initiative is  Neil MacGregor   the institutionâ\x80\x99s former director whose didactic skills as a lecturer and broadcaster have already redefined the role of great museums.

3925,dev,"Most media reports have focused on  his  after-school job as a Stoneman Douglas High football coach ( here   here   here   here   and here ) â but  on Wednesday afternoon   Mr. Feis  was doing  his  day job as a school guard.  Mr. Feis  was legally disarmed by the federal government in  his  attempt to save potentially dozens of children from murder.
 Aaron Feis  was the right man in the right place at the right time  but  he  was legally prevented from using the right  constitutionally protected tool to do the job.  Mr. Feis  was shot on Feb.  at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  shielding students from a killer with  his  own body. Ultimately   he  and  other people  mainly students  died.  Mr. Feis  was truly a remarkable and courageous man.
 Aaron Feis   husband  father  school guard  and football coach  rushed toward the fire and  by all accounts  engaged the shooter Nikolas Cruz soon after Cruz started shooting. The Sun-Sentinel reported that Feis ""was one of the first to respond."" When the ""Code Red"" went off  head football coach Willis May asked over the walkie-talkie whether the sounds were firecrackers.  Feis  retorted: ""Those aren't firecrackers. I'm going in.""
Per Sheriff Israel  Cruz then dropped his rifle and backpack and walked back down the stairs and exited the building. It is not % clear exactly when and where  Aaron Feis  made contact with Nikolas Cruz  and we will not know for sure until the sheriff's office releases more crime scene data  but we can make some reasonable inferences with the information available.
Broward County superintendent Robert Runcie is reported to have stated at a Feb.  press conference: ""We had an athletic director  a campus monitor who responded immediately when there was signs of trouble in the school."" Dave Hyde of the Sun-Sentinel wrote that ""Athletic Director Chris Hixon and  Aaron Feis  died in the same hallway."" Per the graphic in this Washington Post article  the four classrooms on the first floor in which Cruz shot people were all next to each other and close to the east stairwell. Only one person was shot on the second floor. This same article shows that Building  was adjacent to the school parking lot. It is logical to believe that  Feis  was in the parking lot ready to direct traffic as school was about to let out. As it has been reported that  Feis  died while shielding multiple students and only one victim was shot on the second floor  we can infer that  Feis  engaged the shooter on the first floor sometime soon after the shooting began.  Aaron Feis  likely was in the right place at the right time to save lives.
So why was  Aaron Feis  disarmed? Lisa Maxwell of the Broward County Principals and Assistants Association stated to the Sun-Sentinel:
What would have happened if Aaron Feis had had a a Glock on his hip when the Code Red went off? Two cases from the last several years serve as pertinent compare-contrast examples.
On May     Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi attacked the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland  Texas where a free speech event was being held with about  people in attendance. Simpson and Soofi were armed with three pistols and three semi-automatic assault rifles. Despite being heavily outmatched in firepower  a single police officer working as a security guard at the event armed only with a .-caliber Glock pistol shot and wounded the attackers and stopped the attack without any loss of life. Contrast this to the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine office in Paris on January   . Heavily armed men attacked Charlie Hebdo where they shot and killed  people and wounded many others. The first responder was a bicycle cop named Ahmed Merabet. As with  Aaron Feis  Merabet  had been disarmed by  his  government  as France has some the strictest gun control laws in the world  much stricter than those now being emotionally advocated in the United States.  Merabet  was shot and wounded and lay helpless to defend  himself  against  his  AK--wielding attackers  who then calmly walked over and shot  him  dead in the street.
If  Aaron Feis  had had a .-caliber Glock in  his  hand and had been given the proper training  he  needed to do  his  job as school guard  I am convinced that  he  would have saved many lives after  he  bravely called out  ""I'm going in."" Rudyard Kipling once wrote: ""Every so often  a few evil men must die so that weaponless dreamers may live in peace.""

3926,dev,"President Trump on Sunday sought to douse speculation that  he  may fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III amid an intensifying campaign by  Trump  allies to attack the wide-ranging Russia investigation as improper and politically motivated.
Returning to the White House from Camp David   Trump  was asked Sunday whether  he  intended to fire Mueller. âNo  Iâm not â  he  told journalists  insisting that there was âno collusion whatsoeverâ between  his  campaign and Russia.
The presidentâs comments came a day after a lawyer representing Trumpâs transition team accused Mueller of wrongfully obtaining thousands of emails sent and received by  Trump  officials before the start of  his  administration â a legal and public relations maneuver seen as possibly laying the groundwork to oust the special counsel.
 Trump  criticized Mueller for gaining access to those emails  telling reporters the situation was ânot looking good.â
âItâs quite sad to see that â  Trump  said. âMy people were very upset about it.â
The outcry over Muellerâs investigation into Russiaâs  election interference grew louder over the weekend among  Trump  loyalists and conservative media figures. Although  Trump  has publicly and privately criticized the Department of Justice and the FBI and voiced displeasure with  his  appointees there  the presidentâs advisers insisted  he  is not aiming  his  ire at Mueller.
As the special counsel has inched closer to  Trump  with a series of indictments and guilty pleas  including securing the cooperation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn  the presidentâs defenders have spotlighted examples of political bias among two senior FBI officials as proof of a compromised investigation.
FBI lawyer Lisa Page and counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok worked on the Russia investigation. Strzok was removed from Muellerâs team in July after text messages were discovered in which they discussed their dislike of  Trump  and support of Democrat Hillary Clinton; Page had left the team two weeks earlier for what officials said were unrelated reasons. Their text messages were released by the Justice Department last week and are still under review.
Some  Trump  surrogates have said the texts show that Muellerâs investigation is partisan.
âIt looks more and more and more like an attack on the presidency â former  Trump  campaign adviser Michael Caputo said Sunday. âI still donât believe Mueller is in for a silent coup  but I think people around him have shown that this thing is off the rails. . . . These texts and emails were a declaration of their membership in the resistance.â
The attacks have fed speculation about Muellerâs fate. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told a California television station on Friday that âthe rumorâ on Capitol Hill was that  Trump  would fire Mueller at the end of this week  as Congress disperses for a holiday break.
Liberal activist groups have readied mass protests in the event that Mueller is fired.  The sprawling âTrump  Is Not Above the Lawâ coalition says it has more than  demonstrations ready to launch nationwide. Were Mueller to be fired in the morning  events would be held at  p.m. local time; if he were fired in the afternoon or evening  protests would kick off at noon the following day.
Trumpâs aides said the rumors are nonsense. Asked whether the  Trump  transition team lawyerâs complaint was setting the stage for firing Mueller  Marc Short  the White House legislative affairs director  replied  âNo!â
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday on CNNâs âState of the Unionâ that  Trump  did not mention firing the special counsel when they had dinner Saturday night. âI donât have any reason to think that the president is going to do that  but thatâs obviously up to him â he said.
Advisers who have spoken recently with  Trump  about the Russia investigation said the president was sharply critical of Attorney General Jeff Sessions  as well as Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein  who oversees the Mueller operation â but did not broach the idea of firing Mueller.
Rather   Trump  appeared to be contemplating changes in the Justice Departmentâs leadership. In recent discussions  two advisers said   Trump  has called the attorney general âweak â and complained that Rosenstein has shown insufficient accountability on the special counselâs work. A senior official said  Trump  mocked Rosensteinâs recent testimony on Capitol Hill  saying  he  looked weak and unable to answer questions.  Trump  has ranted about Rosenstein as âa Democrat â one of these advisers said  and characterized  him  as a threat to  his  presidency.","['President Trump on Sunday sought to douse speculation that  he  may fire special counsel Robert S.

3927,dev,". Geert Wilders Hate Speech Trials
The most prominent anti-Islamisation figure in the Netherlands today is firebrand politician Geert Wilders  leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV). Over the last few years   Wilders  has been taken to court for âhate speechâ over comments  he  has made about Moroccan migrants and against Muslims in general.
The first hate speech trial began in  over  his  film Fitna which prosecutors argued incited hate against members of the Muslim community.  Wilders  was found not guilty in  during a retrial as the judge viewed  his  comment appropriate in public debate.
In    Wilders  was once again brought before courts for inciting hatred during a  speech in which  he  asked a crowd if they wanted more or fewer Moroccan migrants. The crowd replied  âfewerâ to which  Wilders  then stated  âweâll take care of itâ.
Judges did not view  Wilders  favourably in the case and found him guilty of incitement  although shortly before the verdict   Wilders  made a statement saying: âWhatever the verdict  I will continue to speak the truth about the Moroccan problem  and no judge  politician  or terrorist will stop me.â
Despite the trials   Wilders  and the PVV came second place in last yearâs Dutch national elections.","['.

Later  at a nearby diner   Stilp  smiles contentedly and reflects. ""Today went well ""  he  says before chomping into a veggie burger. This is hardly  his  first rodeo.  He  has been dubbed âthe P.T. Barnum of Pennsylvania politicsâ and is regularly referred to by friends and foes alike as a âmaster of political theater.â Stilpâwho lives in the Harrisburg areaâhas made a name for himself through a variety of creative  prop-laden  media-courting protest stunts. He's particularly well-known in the largely rural swath between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that folks call âPennsyltucky.""
But with his Confederate/Nazi flag-burning demonstrations   Stilp  says  âYou donât bring humor to this at all. When you have Heather Heyer dying at the hands of a neo-Nazi  people who are flying these flags to represent hate and white supremacy  everything is   percent serious.â
âAll across Pennsylvania you see the Confederate flag on peopleâs porches  so we confront them with the true meaning â  Stilp  says. âIt puts them on the defensive. You know  show me why your Confederate flag isnât equal to the Nazi flag? Explain to me why. They say  âWe canât help it if itâs been adopted by the KKK and white supremacist groups.â But itâs not my job to walk it back to where you want it to be. Thatâs the present reality  and it always was a symbol of hate.â
 Stilp  says  he  was motivated to make and burn  his  two-sided flags after seeing white supremacists carrying both flags during the Charlottesville âUnite the Rightâ rally.  He  was also incensed by Scott Perryâa US congressman from mid-state Pennsylvaniaâechoing Trump in blaming âboth sidesâ for the associated violence and Heyerâs death.
 Stilp âs no stranger to flags.  He  designed the lauded Flight  memorial flag to honor those who perished near Shanksville  Pennsylvania  on /. ( Stilp  is also a volunteer firefighter and EMT who rushed to Ground Zero immediately after the terrorist attacks to help conduct search and recovery efforts.)
 His  Confederate/Nazi flags each cost about $  two hours of  his  time  and no small amount of angst to create. âI feel disgusted  disgusted  making these flags  cutting out these stars  gluing a swastika â  Stilp  grimaces. âBut I gotta do it.â
After a few protest burns in Pennsylvania in August and September   Stilp  and Facka decided to take things to another level by taking their flags and fire to the belly of the beast: NASCAR racetracks in the South.
Advance word of their arrival in the local papers and websites drew scores of comments: Desires for  Stilp  to get a bullet in the head were among the more polite and reserved sentiments expressed.
âEhh  fear is overrated â  Stilp  says. Citing his anti-nuclear protests going back to the including piloting a Greenpeace hot-air balloon over government sites in Nevada to stop imminent tests  and numerous instances of arrests and beatdowns by authorities while demonstrating at various facilities âStilp  insists heâs been through worse. Heâs actually skeptical any harm will come to him.
âIâve been telling him that weâre in a different political climate now than heâs used to â Facka says as  Stilp  sighs and bites into his burger. âWeâre much more susceptible to that lone-wolf  that one crazy guy. So I do have a lot of fear  to be honest.â
âMaybe â says  Stilp . âSo what? Iâm who cares?! I just donât want the police who are protecting us to get hurt  thatâs all.â
 Stilp  plans to burn  his  flags outside courthouses in nearly all of Pennsylvaniaâs  counties in the coming months  and maybe head down South again when NASCAR season starts back up next year.
âPeople do email us and say  âThanks for doing that  I donât have the guts to do that.â and things like that  or  âPlease watch yourself. Donât get shot ââ  Stilp  says. âWeâre just trying to educate. Hopefully we can change some behavior.

 Mr. Dobbs  argues that the middle class has many enemies: corporate lobbyists  greedy executives  wimpy journalists  corrupt politicians. But none play a bigger role than illegal immigrants. As  he  sees it  they are stealing our jobs  depressing our wages and even endangering our lives.
âThe invasion of illegal aliens is threatening the health of many Americans â  Mr. Dobbs  said on  his  April     program. From there   he  introduced  his  original report that mentioned leprosy  the flesh-destroying disease â technically known as Hansenâs disease â that has inspired fear for centuries.

3935,dev,"Russia âs president Vladimir Putin  wanted to be the world-renowned diplomat that brought peace to Syria. So last year  he  blew off the UN-sponsored peace talks led by Staffan de Mistura  and  he  joined with Iran and Turkey to form  his  own âpeace talksâ process held in Astana  Kazakhstan. And they came up with a peace plan.
Of course  the peace plan was rejected by the parties actually fighting in Syria: the Syrian regime led by the psychopathic president Bashar al-Assad  the âmoderateâ anti-Assad opposition in Syria  the al-Qaeda linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)  formerly Jabhat al-Nusra  al-Nusra Front  and the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh). All of those four groups rejected the peace plan  so it was ridiculous for  Putin  or anyone else to believe that the peace plan would work.
And it didnât. They came up with four âde-confliction zonesâ or âceasefire zones.â The fighting slowed down a little in these four zones for a little while  but today the whole agreement is in shambles  as the fighting is in full force. It is a total failure by  Vladimir Putin .
There was a meeting of  Putin âs peace plan group in Sochi on Tuesday that  Putin  was calling the âSyrian National Dialogue Congress.â
The meeting was supposed to take two days  but it was called off after one day  when Syrian opposition representatives heckled  Putin âs right-hand man  Russiaâs foreign minister Sergei Lavrov  and then walked out.

So Vladimir Putin took over the peace process business. The UN processes held out a fig leaf of being impartial  but Putin was clearly and unequivocally in favor of Bashar al-Assad and committed to supporting his genocide and war crimes while claiming to be promoting peace.

To  his  supporters   Mikheil Saakashvili   the former Georgian president  is a tireless warrior against corruption and Vladimir Putinâs Russia who transformed his graft-ridden country into a showcase for Western reforms and is one of the most charismatic figures in the post-Soviet sphere.
To  his  enemies  of whom there are many   he  is a confrontational and divisive showboat who has a predilection at times toward authoritarianism and is consumed with a lust for power.
But both sides agree on one thing:  He  doesnât give up a political fight.
Today  Saakashvili  finds  himself  locked in yet another bitter battle â in Ukraine. And  his  main target is an old friend from  his  university days in Kiev in the late : the countryâs president  Petro Poroshenko.
 Saakashvili âs biography has seen numerous turns. A graduate of Columbia Law School  he spearheaded Georgiaâs  âRose Revolutionâ and became a poster boy for the Bush administrationâs international pro-democracy agenda. (The U.S. Secret Service first gave him the âEnergizer Bunnyâ moniker.) He built a glass-walled police headquarters in Tbilisi to underscore his commitment to molding a modern and transparent force.
âThrow the goat out!â  Saakashvili  said in reference to Poroshenko  whom  he  accuses of corruption and blocking reforms to protect  his  allies. Later   he  called  the Ukrainian president  âa cheap Mafioso.â
The government is fighting back. This year  Ukrainian authorities said  Saakashvili  incorrectly filled out his citizenship application  and they stripped him of the Ukrainian passport he obtained in   barring him from entering the country. (He was in the United States at the time of the announcement.) The move drew heavy international criticism and rendered  Saakashvili  a stateless former head of state  since Georgia had revoked his passport when he received Ukrainian citizenship.
In September   Saakashvili  responded by storming through a border crossing into Ukraine with hundreds of  his  supporters.  He  subsequently announced a âunited oppositionâ against Poroshenko and barnstormed the country to garner support and raise  his  profile.
Last week  Ukraineâs prosecutor general  Yuri Lutsenko  a Poroshenko ally  announced that authorities had rejected Saakashviliâs petition for political asylum  opening up his possible deportation to Georgia  where he is wanted on charges of embezzlement and abuse of power while in office.  Saakashvili  says the case against  him  in Georgia is a political witch hunt.
Lutsenko also accused  Saakashvili  of trying to organize âa violent coupâ and obtaining visas for  of his Georgian supporters under false pretenses.  Saakashvili   for  his  part  denied the accusations and said authorities had illegally seized and deported a number of  his  followers.
âThe general prosecutor is lying completely!â  Saakashvili  wrote in a Facebook post  claiming that Ukrainian law allowed him to stay in the country.
For  Saakashvili   deportation would be an ignominious end to what was supposed to be  his  political resurrection. When  he  arrived in Ukraine over two years ago as an exile  Poroshenko installed  him  as Odessa governor in hopes that the Georgian could work  his  reformist magic on one of Ukraineâs most corrupt regions.
â Mikhail Saakashvili  is my friend from our student years. I remember  him  as a strong and decisive person  and I have reason to trust  him  â Poroshenko tweeted at the time.
The trust  however  soon turned into open antipathy.  Saakashvili  said the Kiev government was impeding  his  reforms and resigned as governor one year later  lashing out at PoroÂ­shenko and other top officials.  He  launched  his  own political movement and started a talk show. On one episode  a female war veteran sang a song called âThe Chocolate Ass.â Few missed the reference: Poroshenko is a billionaire candy tycoon.
But there are political figures  including within the opposition itself  who are uncomfortable with  Saakashvili âs emergence as a Ukrainian rabble-rouser â the demonstration in front of the parliament being a case in point  they say.","['They call  him  â\x80\x9cthe Energizer Bunny.â\x80\x9d', 'To  his  supporters   Mikheil Saakashvili   the former Georgian president  is a tireless warrior against corruption and Vladimir Putinâ\x80\x99s Russia who transformed his graft-ridden country into a showcase for Western reforms and is one of the most charismatic figures in the post-Soviet sphere.', 'To  his  enemies  of whom there are many   he  is a confrontational and divisive showboat who has a predilection at times toward authoritarianism and is consumed with a lust for power.', 'But both sides agree on one thing:  He  doesnâ\x80\x99t give up a political fight.', 'Today  Saakashvili  finds  himself  locked in yet another bitter battle â\x80\x94 in Ukraine.
