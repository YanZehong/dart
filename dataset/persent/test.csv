 Aquino  facing his first major test barely two months after taking office  said he will now focus on preventing a repeat of the incident. The public and the media have questioned why the president wasn't more visible and involved.
 ""The first thing I will admit is I am not perfect and I can learn "" said Aquino  who said he was following the developments from his office. Later  he went to a restaurant near the downtown Manila park where the hostages were held to meet with officials  but he did not want to be ""back seat driving"" or looking over the shoulders of those handling the crisis  he said.
 Aquino said that there was a point when he was piqued by police commandos in their haphazard assault on the bus. ""I lost my patience "" he said. ""Every mistake that I saw  I pointed out. That was perhaps my way of being 'hands on.'""
 He said a police Special Action Force trained for hostage rescue that had held a training exercise earlier that day was not deployed as promised.

 ""We're not trying to do a retrospective  and we're not even trying to do a finite or just confined Maurizio Cattelan show "" says former Menil curator Franklin Sirmans  who organized the exhibition. ""It has to be about the collection as much as it is about him. For him  it was also about  wanting to just dissolve or mesh into the collection.""
 Sculptures by Cattelan will be in the galleries that recently held the exhibit ""Joaquin Torres-Garcia: Constructing Abstraction With Wood."" But they'll mingle with Menil-owned works by -century artists such as Andy Warhol  Robert Rauschenberg  Jasper Johns  Cy Twombly  Bruce Nauman  Ed Ruscha  James Lee Byars and Francis Bacon.
 ""Warhol obviously has had a profound influence on Maurizio -- and probably more so a profound influence on the perception of Maurizio than it really has on him "" Sirmans says. He added that when curators ""talk about hype and cult of celebrity around the artist  I think sometimes Maurizio gets thrown into that discussion"" with contemporaries like Damien Hirst  Takashi Murakami and Jeff Koons.

 In some respects mirroring the de Menils' journey from their native France to Houston  the collection they built emphasizes European art up to the first half of the  century and largely shifts to an American focus in the second half.

3971,test,"In his first full-fledged session with the media since his life fell apart  Woods entered the interview room with a smile on his face and stopped to hug one of the green-jacketed club members  Ron Townsend.
 Woods again took full blame for his personal failings but stopped short of providing many new details. He wouldn't say why he entered rehab for  days nor would he go into specifics about his infamous November night car crash  other than to say it took five stitches to close a lip wound.
 He said his wife  Elin  would not be at Augusta. His personal life fell apart after revelations that he had multiple extramarital affairs during their  /-year marriage.
 Woods thanked his fellow golfers for the support he's received since announcing his return to the PGA Tour and said he was pleasantly surprised how well the fans treated him during a practice round Monday.
 The outing was his first before a gallery since the sex scandal made him a tawdry tabloid fixture. He even flashed a bit of uncharacteristic charm  stopping to sign autographs -- something he rarely does -- while heading to the practice range to get in a few extra swings.
 ""The encouragement I got  it blew me away "" he said. ""It really did. The people here over the years  I know they've been extremely respectful. But today is just something that touched my heart pretty good.""","['In his first full-fledged session with the media since his life fell apart  Woods entered the interview room with a smile on his face and stopped to hug one of the green-jacketed club members  Ron Townsend.', "" Woods again took full blame for his personal failings but stopped short of providing many new details.

REUTERS / Romeo Ranoco The investigation by the rights group on the bloody five - month battle was based on interviews with  witnesses from September until early November and called for an independent inquiry . The conflict in Marawi   the only predominantly Muslim city in the mainly Catholic Philippines   was the country ’ s biggest and longest battle since World War Two . More than     people   mostly insurgents   were killed   including  soldiers and  civilians   according to the authorities . At least     people were displaced and large parts of Marawi have been decimated by air strikes . Witnesses described at least  separate incidents where at least  people were executed by the Muslim extremists because they were Christians . Amnesty described those as war crimes . It also said  hostages may have been killed in a single bombing run by the armed forces   and said an independent inquiry should include an assessment as to whether the air strikes were proportionate to the threat . “ They must initiate a prompt   effective and impartial investigation into whether its bombings of civilian neighborhoods was proportional under international humanitarian law  ” Tirana Hassan   Amnesty International ’ s crisis response director   said in a statement . “ The Philippine authorities must bring those responsible for torture and other violations to justice and ensure that the victims receive adequate reparations .”  Major - General Restituto Padilla   armed forces spokesman    said the military was aware of the report and would respond in full later .

3976,test,Republicans have been talking about their desire to cut taxes for so long it ’ s easy to forget they haven ’ t actually released legislation to do so . That will likely change on Thursday   when House leaders plan to unveil a bill they ’ ve long promised would be the most far - reaching overhaul of the U . S . tax code in more than  years . The big reveal was initially pegged for Wednesday but was pushed back as Republicans struggle to put the finishing touches on an exceedingly complex piece of legislation . Its introduction will mark the start of an ambitious legislative timetable : President Trump said Tuesday he wants the House to pass its bill by Thanksgiving and that he wants the legislation on his desk by Christmas . “ There ’ s never been anything like this in the history of our country  ”  Trump  promised . “ It ’ s cuts and it ’ s relief and it ’ s also reform .” Related Story How  Trump  Is Endangering  His  Prized Tax Cuts Whether  he  gets  his  wish will depend on how lawmakers   industry lobbyists   and the public receive the details of a plan hashed out in secret   many of which will involve politically difficult tradeoffs designed to keep the cost of the GOP plan under $  .  trillion . What Republicans have publicized about their proposal to this point have been the benefits : a cut in the corporate tax rate to  percent from its current  percent   collapsing seven income tax brackets for individuals to three or four   doubling the standard deduction   and expanding the child tax credit . What comes out on Thursday will be the fine print . And despite the president ’ s bravado   Republicans on Capitol Hill recognize the steepest climb remains ahead of them . “ Make no mistake   all hell ’ s going to break loose when that House bill becomes public  ” Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana told CNN . “ It ’ s taking a big ole piece of cheesecake and putting a bunch of spinach on top and saying   ‘ You can ’ t eat the cheesecake ’ til you eat the spinach .’” The House bill will still have to survive a markup in the Ways and Means Committee next week   and Senate Republicans are working on their own proposal   though it ’ s expected to be broadly similar . Thursday ’ s announcement   however   will provide answers to several important questions that have vexed Republican legislators for months . Here are a few of the big ones : Who Will Pay More ? Despite the president ’ s apparent preference for a clean tax cut   the House Republican proposal will be a broader and more complicated shift in who owes what to the government . And that means   as GOP leaders have reluctantly acknowledged   that some people will actually see their taxes go up . “ Yes   some Americans probably will ” pay more   House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy conceded on Fox News . “ Because you know what we do ? We close the loopholes .” The nitty - gritty revealed in the GOP plan will allow news sites and think tanks to develop calculators that show exactly who wins and who loses . Politically   it could cut two ways . If those analyses show that the wealthier will pay more   the tax bill would become more attractive to some Democratic senators and make it easier for Republicans to pass . But the indications so far are that in some states   it ’ ll be the middle and upper - middle class that gets hit   either because of proposed changes to  retirement plans or the elimination of the federal deduction for state - and - local taxes . And if that ’ s the case   the GOP plan becomes a much tougher sell . How Do the Rich Fare ? The treatment of the wealthy has been one of the more interesting subplots of the Republican tax - reform drive   revealing both philosophical and strategic differences within the party . Led by Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady   the supply - side conservatives writing the House bill believe in lowering the top marginal tax rate to encourage investment and new hiring   and they reject Democratic arguments that the rich should pay more — no matter how popular they may be — as class warfare . If Ryan and Brady get their way   the highest income - tax bracket would go back down from  .  percent to  percent   where it stood during the George W . Bush administration before President Barack Obama demanded that Congress raise it on income above $     a year . But Trump   who ran as a populist   is sensitive to attacks on the GOP plan as a giveaway to the wealthy . At his insistence   Republicans included a possible fourth bracket for the highest - earners in the framework they released last month   and Ryan has said that will probably stay in the bill . It ’ s likely to keep the top rate at  .  percent   but possibly only for income above $  million or a higher threshold than it is currently . Other tax breaks benefiting the rich are likely to provoke intra - party squabbles . Trump   Ryan and most conservatives have pledged to repeal the estate tax   or “ death tax  ” as they call it   which only hits inheritances valued at more than $  million . But a few GOP senators   including moderate Susan Collins of Maine   have balked at the idea   and a compromise could be in the works . As I wrote last month   the biggest political land mine for Republicans is their proposal to prohibit people from deducting their state - and - local taxes   or SALT   from their federal bill . The GOP needs the $  .  trillion in revenue it could generate to pay for its cuts to the corporate and individual income rates   but ending the tax break would punish Americans in higher tax states like New York   New Jersey   Illinois   and California . The provision nearly took down the GOP plan already   when lawmakers from New York and New Jersey rebelled against the party budget . Their protests forced a compromise   but it ’ s unclear whether it ’ ll be enough to satisfy the concerns of enough members to ensure passage . Brady said in a radio interview on Tuesday that the tax bill would preserve a deduction for local property taxes but not for state - and - local income taxes . That solution has already cost Republicans the support of trade associations representing realtors and home builders   powerful industry lobbies who say the combined changes in the bill would depress home values . The most surprising proposal to leak out of the generally secretive GOP deliberations was the idea of taxing contributions to  retirement plans up - front rather than when people withdraw their funds later in life . Like the SALT proposal   this was about Republicans needing to raise revenue somewhere to pay for tax cuts elsewhere . The popular  plans was a curious target since they are used by middle - class as well as wealthier people   and the idea appeared to die a quick death once Trump rejected it in a tweet . But Brady soon made clear that changes to  plans remained under consideration — an example of minor congressional rebellion that   more than anything   underscored how desperate Republicans are to find offsets for their tax cuts . One possibility is that the bill unveiled this week will increase the cap on annual  contributions   which is currently $       but lower the amount that people can set aside without paying taxes on it . Democrats are likely to hammer the proposal either way   and to set up a clear contrast with Republicans   they announced their own measure to expand — rather than limit — the tax break for retirement savings . As GOP aides quickly pointed out   however   the benefits of the Democratic plan would actually accrue mostly to wealthy people who could afford to contribute more than $     a year to retirement accounts . How Much Is a Child Worth ? Republicans have already said they ’ ll include a proposal championed by Ivanka Trump to increase the child tax credit   which currently stands at $     per kid for lower and middle - income families . What we don ’ t know is how high it ’ ll go . Some in the party want to double it to $       but at a cost of $  billion over  years   that could be too expensive for a plan that ’ s at risk of busting the budget as it is . The GOP could also choose to make a slightly smaller credit available to more people by expanding the income threshold for families .,['Republicans have been talking about their desire to cut taxes for so long it ’ s easy to forget they haven ’ t actually released legislation to do so .

3977,test,Michigan State University ’ s athletic director announced Friday  he  is stepping down over  the scandal involving sicko sports doc Larry Nassar   who molested young female athletes at the school  . Mark Hollis told reporters at a press conference on campus that  he  will be “ retiring ” and  his  last day will be Jan .  . “ Our campus   and beyond   has been attacked by evil   an individual who broke trust and so much more  ” Hollis said   referring to Nassar . “ As a campus community   we must do everything we can to ensure this never happens again — to make sure any sexual assault never occurs . But to do so   we must listen and learn lessons .” Hollis continued : “ Only then can we truly begin the process of healing . I have tried to do this since first learning about the abuse in September  .” He called his decision to step down from his decade - long post “ not an easy decision .” “ I am not running away from anything   I am running toward something . Comfort   compassion and understanding for the survivors and our community — togetherness   time and love for my family  ” Hollis said . Hollis has been the athletic director at the scandal - plagued school since  and he is a  MSU alum . “ I have always been a Spartan   and always will be . It ’ s been an absolute honor to guide the Athletic Department for the last decade .” His announcement comes after  Nassar   a former USA Gymnastics doctor who was on the faculty at MSU    was handed a prison sentence of up to  years Wednesday after more than  women accused  him  of years - long sexual abuse . Hollis said that in his retirement   he will “ fully cooperate ” with the Michigan attorney general ’ s plan to investigate MSU ’ s role in Nassar ’ s widespread sex abuse and the investigation of the NCAA   “ and any other investigations .” “ As a university   we must focus on the healing of the survivors and the entire community  ” Hollis said . Earlier this week   the NCAA said it was launching an investigation into how MSU handled the allegations against the twisted physician . Just hours after Nassar ’ s sentencing Wednesday   MSU president Lou Anna Simon resigned . “ As tragedies are politicized   blame is inevitable .

3982,test,A new audit about a Pentagon agency losing hundreds of millions of dollars is reported by Politico as an “ exclusive .” While that ’ s technically correct   a government agency losing or wasting or misplacing millions   billions and even trillions of dollars ( this is not hyperbole   folks ) is nothing new . Politico ’ s report is a reminder of what bloated   unaccountable government gets you . “ Ernst & Young found that the Defense Logistics Agency failed to properly document more than $  million in construction projects   just one of a series of examples where it lacks a paper trail for millions of dollars in property and equipment  ” Politico reported . “ Across the board   its financial management is so weak that its leaders and oversight bodies have no reliable way to track the huge sums it ’ s responsible for   the firm warned in its initial audit of the massive Pentagon purchasing agent .” The report describes the Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA ) as the “ Walmart ” of the military   an entity with     employees who provide “ everything from poultry to pharmaceuticals   precious metals and aircraft parts .” The problem is   we don ’ t know where their money goes . The report reveals issues ranging from “ misstatements ” in the agency ’ s books   lack of documentation about projects that are in motion   to no documentation at all for $  million in spending . What ’ s even more shocking is the blase response from the agency itself . When contacted by Politico   the agency wasn ’ t surprised by the conclusion   and insisted it “ will overcome its many hurdles to ultimately get a clean audit .” ” ‘ The initial audit has provided us with a valuable independent view of our current financial operations  ’ Army Lt . Gen .

Can you imagine if you were the accountant for a small firm and you explained the $     missing from the books as a “ weakness ” in your “ internal controls  ” and expected to get away with it ?

( You know   to reduce Afghani unemployment ). And this from Forbes in December  : “ On July       the Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) issued a report ‘ Army General Fund Adjustments Not Adequately Documented or Supported .’ The report indicates that for fiscal year  the Army failed to provide adequate support for $  .  trillion in journal voucher adjustments .” These details could give you the idea that funny business with your tax dollars is the exclusive purview of the Pentagon . While the military gets its share of scrutiny because of the budget   this is a government - wide issue . Our problem is based in financial chaos fostered by absurd decision - making and bad management at every agency and throughout our massive   unaccountable bureaucracy . Case in point : The New York Times reported this past Tuesday that FEMA paid $  million to an Atlanta entrepreneur to provide  million meals to the people of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria . The Times reported that  Tiffany Brown   of Tribute Contracting   LLC    had no experience in large - scale disaster relief .

3983,test,Montana will sign contracts only with internet service providers that honor “ net neutrality ” firms    Governor Steve Bullock  said on Monday   the latest effort by a state to undermine a Federal Communications Commission order rolling back rules introduced in  .  Bullock  signed an executive order requiring state contract recipients to adhere to so - called net neutrality   which barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes   also known as paid prioritization . The Republican - majority FCC voted in December along party lines to reverse the  rules . The new rules will not take effect for at least three months   the FCC has said . A spokeswoman for the FCC declined to comment on the decision by Bullock   a Democrat . “ There has been a lot of talk around the country about how to respond to the recent decision by Federal Communications Commission to repeal net neutrality rules   which keep the internet free and open . It ’ s time to actually do something about it  ” Bullock said in a statement . “ This is a simple step states can take to preserve and protect net neutrality . We can ’ t wait for folks in Washington DC to come to their senses and reinstate these rules .” Other states are considering similar efforts . The FCC order in December said it would block state and local rules that “ could impose far greater burdens than the federal regulatory regime .” Last week   a group of  U . S . state attorneys general and the District of Columbia   filed legal papers to challenge the FCC ’ s decision to do away with net neutrality while Democrats said they needed just one more vote in the Senate to repeal the FCC ruling . Republicans control both chambers of Congress   so even if Democrats could win a Senate majority   a repeal would also require winning a vote in the House of Representatives and would then still be subject to a likely veto by President Donald Trump .

Wray ' s timeline of events . ( Jenny Starrs / The Washington Post ) The White House ' s claims of no previous knowledge about domestic violence allegations against former staff secretary Rob Porter were challenged by FBI Director Christopher A . Wray ' s timeline of events . ( Jenny Starrs / The Washington Post ) The White House struggled Tuesday to contain a widening crisis over its handling of domestic violence allegations against a senior official   as it reeled after sworn testimony by the FBI chief directly contradicted what President Trump ’ s aides had presented as the official version of events . FBI Director Christopher A . Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the bureau had completed a background report on then - staff secretary Rob Porter last July and closed out the case entirely last month . Wray ’ s account is at odds with White House claims that the investigation required for Porter ’ s security clearance was “ ongoing ” until he left his job last week   after his two ex - wives publicly alleged physical and emotional abuse . The latest bout of turbulence is exacerbated by the administration ’ s reputation   earned over  chaotic months   for flouting institutional norms and misrepresenting facts to the public — a culture set by the president himself . The public relations fallout is further compounded by Trump ’ s own history of alleged sexual assault and his seeming reluctance to publicly condemn violence against women and give voice to the national # MeToo reckoning . The president has said little publicly about the Porter issue other than to praise the former aide for doing “ a very good job .” But he has privately expressed frustration with the week - long fallout   peppering advisers and confidants with questions about the media coverage and how the controversy is playing for him personally . FBI Director Christopher A . Wray said Feb .  the FBI had submitted a partial report on former White House aide Rob Porter ’ s background check in March  and a full investigation in late July to the White House . ( Reuters ) The Porter drama has become all - consuming   creating an atmosphere of chaos and infighting reminiscent of the “ Game of Thrones ” stage early in Trump ’ s presidency — and distracting from the administration ’ s budget and infrastructure agenda . Many aides blame Kelly Inside the West Wing   a growing number of aides blamed Trump ’ s second White House chief of staff   John F . Kelly   for the bungled handling of the allegations against Porter . Trump in recent days has begun musing about possible replacements   according to people with knowledge of the conversations .  Asked by a reporter to assess Kelly ’ s standing with Trump after a week of troubling revelations   White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that “ the president has confidence in his chief of staff .” But Kelly does not enjoy the confidence of an increasing number of his subordinates   some of whom said they believe that the retired four - star Marine Corps general has misled them . Kelly is “ a big fat liar  ” said one White House official   who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share a candid opinion . “ To put it in terms the general would understand   his handling of the Porter scandal amounts to dereliction of duty .” This portrait of the West Wing in turmoil is based on interviews with more than a dozen top White House officials and outside advisers and confidants   most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution . White House chief of staff John F . Kelly is under fire   even from some West Wing colleagues . ( Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post ) Kelly ’ s attempts at explaining his role   according to some aides   have included telling senior staff members last Friday to communicate a version of events many believed to be false   as well as telling at least one confidant that he has “ a good bulls --- detector ” and had long detected troubling characteristics in  Porter  . But Kelly initially defended  Porter  last week as “ a man of true integrity and honor .” And in recent weeks   Kelly was even considering giving  Porter  an expanded role in policy development   a potential promotion first reported by CNN .  “ Credibility is the coin of the realm for any White House chief of staff   and it ’ s especially important in a White House where truth was the first casualty and credibility has been the second  ” said Chris Whipple   who wrote a book about chiefs of staff . The internal animus is not limited to Kelly . White House counsel Donald McGahn and deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin are also facing scrutiny over how Porter managed to work at the White House — and hold an interim security clearance — for more than a year despite the allegations of abuse during his two marriages . Wray disputes account On Tuesday   Wray contradicted the White House ’ s account of when the bureau informed officials about the status of Porter ’ s security clearance investigation . White House officials had said that they were first contacted last summer by the FBI about Porter ’ s clearance   and that the investigation as of last week was “ ongoing ” and had not been completed . But Wray   testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee   said that the FBI submitted a partial report on Porter ’ s clearance last March and that the investigation was completed last July .

Several Kelly antagonists have sought to fan speculation that his position may be in imminent danger   noting that Trump has been seeking counsel from friends about who he might bring on as a new chief of staff . The president has floated replacing Kelly with either Gary Cohn   the director of the National Economic Council   or House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif .) — though Trump has often sounded out friends about personnel changes that he ultimately does not make .

For the past two days   Sanders has acknowledged that the White House could have handled the  Porter  situation better   a sentiment first offered last week by her deputy   Raj Shah   and echoed by Vice President Pence . But Kelly   in comments to the Wall Street Journal on Monday   said   “ It was all done right .” Some of Kelly ’ s colleagues offered a more innocuous explanation for his missteps ; one senior White House official suggested that he may simply have been “ forgetful or inartful  ” rather than deliberately mendacious .

Menendez  has been accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence . Both  Menendez  and the doctor   Salomon Melgen   maintained their innocence . The Justice Department announced on Jan .  its intention to retry  Menendez  and Melgen . “ The conduct alleged in the indictment is serious and warrants retrial before a jury of citizens in the District of New Jersey  ” said the Justice Department . “ The decision to retry this case was made based on the facts and the law   following a careful review .” Menendez ’ s office said in a statement Friday that he “ fully intends to be vindicated – again .” “ We regret that the DOJ   after spending millions and millions of taxpayer dollars   and failing to prove a single allegation in a court of law   has decided to double down on an unjust prosecution  ” his office said .

Melgen allegedly directed more than $     in campaign contributions to entities that supported  Menendez    according to the indictment   which prosecutors said were inducements to get  Menendez  to use  his  influence on Melgen ' s behalf . Prosecutors have also accused  Menendez  of trying to hide the gifts . Melgen paid for  Menendez  and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $     per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet   according to prosecutors . Federal prosecutors said that  Menendez  “ sold  his  office for a lifestyle that  he  couldn ’ t afford .” The indictment also alleged that  Menendez  pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen ' s girlfriends . What was the senator ’ s defense ? Both  Menendez  and Melgen pleaded not guilty – and  Menendez  has vehemently denied the accusations against  him  . Throughout the original trial   defense attorneys sought to prove that  Menendez  and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator   and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together . Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen ? Melgen was convicted of  counts of health care fraud in April  in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U . S .

4006,test,"Woody Allen Is Just Trolling Us Now
We should also  then  invent a new word for the problem with  Woody Allen   who seems to be pretty much rubbing it in our faces at this point. As has been well covered   Allen  has long been the subject of numerous charges of sexual abuse and general morally reprehensible behavior.  He  reportedly began dating  his  wife  Soon-Yi Previn—who is  years  his  junior and to whom  he  has been married since —when she was a teenager still living with her adoptive mother   Allen ’s longtime girlfriend Mia Farrow.  Allen ’s adopted daughter  Dylan Farrow  wrote a New York Times open letter in  that detailed her allegations of childhood sexual abuse against the director. This is all to say that for a long time now   Allen  has been a primary go-to example of artists whose real-life behavior raises uncomfortable questions about their work and how  or if  audiences should engage with that work. But those questions now seem to be morphing into something related but slightly different. Perhaps a query like  ""Is Woody Allen’s directorial career just a front for trolling us now?""
That’s because yet again  Woody Allen is apparently making a movie about a significantly older man having sex with a much younger woman  possibly a minor. According to snoops at the New York Post’s Page Six  the film “centers around a middle-aged man who is sleeping with a much younger woman ” along with a bunch of “young starlets ” one of whom is somewhere between  and . The main character  per the Post  “makes a fool of himself over every ambitious starlet and model.” This is not  by a long shot  the first time  Allen  has made a movie using this premise; the theme of old dude/young girl has basically become one of  his  calling cards. But after pumping out a steady stream of films that we now recognize offer an unvarnished look into  Allen ’s psyche  it feels like we maybe don’t need to know more.
Keep in mind that this isn’t just about  Allen ’s own questionable behavior  but timing: the film happens to be shooting as allegations of rape and sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein roll in.  Allen  is also fresh off a jag of admitting  his  previous awareness of Weinstein’s behavior  dismissing the importance of accusers’ claims and expressing sympathy...with the scandal's sexual predator. Earlier this month   Allen  noted that no one had told  him  Weinstein-related “horror stories”—at least  not “with any real seriousness ” you see—which  he  suggested was a smart move  because  he  wouldn’t have cared anyway. (“ou are not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie.”) In two separate messages   Allen  expressed sadness for Weinstein  and also fretted about how tough this might make things for dudes who are into lowkey workplace sexual harassment.
“You also don’t want it to lead to a witch hunt atmosphere  a Salem atmosphere  where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself ”  Allen  noted  emphasis mine  his heart breaking for winking creeps in cubicles next to yours around this country. “That’s not right either.”
From Manhattan to this new film  in his words and work   Allen  keeps telling us who  he  is. It seems safe to say  message received. These are quotations and actions from a man who can’t be bothered to get it  partly because he's confident he'll never lose his career over that failure  and he may be right. Hollywood keeps giving him the money to make films  the backing to perpetually rehash his therapy sessions  a bully pulpit from which to sympathize with fellow abusers and awards that reinforce his sense that all this is just fine. It's a set-up that's made him very comfortable here  so he keeps going back to the well and dredging up material and arguably  very nearly trolling us by now. But here's hoping  even for those of us who once enjoyed him  this feels like right time for a wrap.","['Woody Allen Is Just Trolling Us Now', 'We should also  then  invent a new word for the problem with  Woody Allen   who seems to be pretty much rubbing it in our faces at this point.

4014,test,"As Brexit gets nearer  British firms are exporting more to the other  countries in the European Union  a state of affairs that will linger over the difficult discussions ahead on the U.K's future relationship with the bloc.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has called it a ""sweet spot "" with exporters benefiting from the near  percent fall in the pound's value against the euro ""in anticipation of a Brexit that has not yet happened."" The euro  which is used by  EU countries  is now worth . pound  compared with around . pound before the referendum.
But  Brexit  is happening and no one  it seems  quite knows what it will mean. That's a particular problem for businesses that have enjoyed tariff-free trade with the EU for decades thanks to the bloc's single market and its customs union.
The Conservative British government has made clear that  Brexit  means leaving both the single market and the customs union. However  it hopes to negotiate a new free trade agreement that will prevent the return of costly customs checks and tariffs.
No one is sure how that can happen and discussions this week within the British government failed to clarify its vision of the post-Brexit relationship.
A deep split within the Conservative party has emerged in recent months. Some lawmakers in Prime Minister Theresa May's party want close ties with the remaining  EU nations and a period of transition after Brexit day. Others want a more fundamental break and are comfortable with the idea of tariffs on trade with the EU if it gives Britain more leeway to carve out trade deals with fast-growing economies around the world  particularly in Asia.
May hopes to agree soon on the terms of a transition deal that would see Britain remain in the single market and customs union for a period after the Brexit exit. That would give firms and households time to adjust.
""As we move through the Brexit process  more needs to be done to provide clarity on what the future trading relationship with the EU will look like "" said Suren Thiru  head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.
Michel Barnier  the EU's chief Brexit negotiator  said Friday the transition is ""not yet sealed"" and that barriers to trade  such as border checks  would be inevitable if Britain opts out of the single market and the customs union. Barriers can also include everything from tariffs to legal red tape.
Proponents of Brexit say Britain would be able to thrive even in that environment as the country could have more freedom in trade discussions with countries like China  India and even the United States.
Even though the relative importance of EU trade is greater for Britain  Brexit proponents argue that EU countries have a lot to lose  too  if free trade is interrupted. Germany  which is Europe's biggest economy  is the No.  seller of goods to Britain — it sold . billion pounds worth of goods to Britain in   or around . percent of Britain's total imports. That's a lot of BMWs and Volkswagen Golfs.
Brexit-backers also say the EU is a major consumer of British services  particularly in finance  and that will help the sides reach a deal.
However the Brexit process pans out — and Carney has said he expects more ""twists and turns"" — the British economy and the EU are inextricably linked  so both sides may be treading carefully in the months ahead.","[""As Brexit gets nearer  British firms are exporting more to the other  countries in the European Union  a state of affairs that will linger over the difficult discussions ahead on the U.K's future relationship with the bloc."", 'Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has called it a ""sweet spot "" with exporters benefiting from the near  percent fall in the pound\'s value against the euro ""in anticipation of a Brexit that has not yet happened.""

4018,test,"Death row inmate Alva Campbell  became mildly agitated when officials tried lowering  him  to a normal execution position in an Oct.  test  according to a medical review by Dr. James McWeeney  a contractor for the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.
McWeeney noted there were no objective findings such as increased pulse rate or breathing to corroborate  Campbell 's anxiety.
McWeeney also said he couldn't find veins suitable for inserting an IV on either of  Campbell 's arms.
 Campbell  is scheduled to die Nov.  for fatally shooting teenager Charles Dials during a  carjacking.
 Campbell 's attorneys also say  he  uses a walker  relies on an external colostomy bag  requires four breathing treatments a day and may have lung cancer.
 Campbell 's health problems ""could create a spectacle of a terminally ill man  with tourniquets on  his  arms and legs  being stabbed repeatedly to no avail "" defense attorney David Stebbins said Monday.
The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said it ""has taken  Campbell 's medical conditions under consideration for planning of possible accommodations for  his  execution.""
 Campbell  was regularly beaten  sexually abused and tortured as a child  Stebbins and other attorneys argued in court filings and before the Ohio Parole Board.
The board rejected  Campbell 's request for mercy earlier this month. Republican Gov. John Kasich  who has spared some inmates while rejecting clemency for others  has the final say.
Prosecutors say  Campbell 's health claims are ironic given he faked paralysis to escape court custody the day he killed Dials.
 Campbell  was paroled in  after serving  years for killing a man in a Cleveland bar. On April      Campbell  was in a wheelchair when he overpowered a Franklin County sheriff's deputy on the way to a court hearing on several armed robbery charges  records show.
 Campbell  took the deputy's gun  carjacked the -year-old Dials and drove around with him for several hours before shooting him twice in the head as Dials crouched in the footwell of his own truck  according to court records.

4024,test,"Even some  Taylor Swift  diehards had to be cringing after  the singer  ushered in the publicity push for  her  latest album with ""Look What You Made Me Do ” a single in which one of the most famous people in the world complained about all  her  famous rivals — which could be everyone from  her  ex Calvin Harris to frequent antagonist Kanye West.
The song also proclaimed the demise of the “old Taylor ” which really is old news. “Old  Taylor ” keeps getting dumped with each new  Taylor  release  and her sixth studio album  “Reputation” (Big Machine)  is no exception.
 Swift  puts  her  guitar on the shelf in favor of synth-heavy productions that crackle and groove  a kind of EDM lite with a touch of hip-hop in service of sleek hooks.
It turns out that “Look What You Made Me Do” is an outlier on an album of love songs.  Swift  has a new real-life boyfriend  and  her  newfound contentment appears to have muted  her  desire to play tit for tat.
Only ""I Did Something Bad"" revels in payback. “This is how the world works ”  she  sings as  she  tries to justify  her  narrator’s “he had it coming” cruelty.
 Taylor ’s penchant for getting in the last word in any dissing match has given  her  music an extra layer of mildly sleazy allure. Without the subtext   the singer  is essentially a pop appropriator  able to absorb whatever sound and producer suits  her  desire for continual reinvention.  She ’s a savvy businesswoman who understands the shifting tides of  her  audience and the pop marketplace more clearly than most music industry executives. And so  her  albums are as much perfectly executed marketing plans as they are musical statements. They are designed to press buttons and achieve predictable results: Four straight No.  albums and nearly  million album sales at a time of declining profits in recorded music.
Little wonder  her  music rarely sounds so unruffled  so sure of itself.  Her  earliest albums boasted a callow  openhearted charm   her  transparency about the awkwardness of teenager-hood striking a chord with  her  young fans. But in adulthood  calculation and cash have usurped raw diary entries as guiding principles. Now when  she ’s picking at the carcass of an ex-lover or taking shots at Kanye or Kim  it feeds the churn in the gossipy corners of social media more than upsetting musical convention.
But the  Swift  who used to treat  her  fans like confidantes instead of a marketing demographic resurfaces only as the album winds down. On “Call It What you Want ”  she  sounds quietly liberated as  she  sings  “nobody’s heard from me for months” but “I’m better than I ever was.”  She  wears a wan  bleary smile as  she  paints the mood of a post-holiday bash on “New Year’s Day”: “There’s glitter on the floor after the party/ Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby.” For a brief moment  Swift sounds like one of  her  fans again.

Duch told the UN-backed war crimes court that Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot  who died in   applied a mix of communist ideas to orchestrate extreme social reforms.
But he said the regime had ""more seriously cruel policies than those of (the) Gang of Four of China"" since it enslaved the population on collective farms and began to carry out mass killings immediately after seizing power.
""The policy of (the Khmer Rouge) was criminal "" Duch said. ""The killing was widespread.""
He added that only the ""collective peasant class and collective worker class"" remained throughout the country after the educated and elites were murdered.
Duch apologised at his trial late March  saying he accepted blame for the extermination of thousands of people at the prison  which served as the centre of the - regime's security apparatus.
On Monday Duch told the trial that his staff had murdered babies by smashing them against trees at a ""killing field"".
But he has denied prosecutors' claims that he played a central role in the Khmer Rouge's iron-fisted rule  and maintains he only tortured two people himself and never personally executed anyone.

! The Kennedy Center announced Tuesday that Oprah Winfrey  the doyenne of daytime television  will be among the five artists receiving this year's Kennedy Center Honors.
 The selection of Winfrey may be startling  but it's not without precedent. The choice harks back to  when late-night television host Johnny Carson was selected  breaking the long line of honorees who were strictly traditional performing artists. Winfrey  taking a break from taping for her  season and reviewing the nearly   hours of footage  let out with a buoyant ""Wow-zee!""
 She explained  ""This feels like an official American citizenship in a very exclusive club of artists and contributors to the nation in a very special way. It feels like an elevated kind of award and there aren't many in this category. They look at your work  your life work  who you are as a human being and the spirit of who you are as a human being. Not many honors look at that depth.""
 The  lineup is an ideal Oprah-esque round table. Each chosen artist's life has been brushed by hardship and tragedy. Winfrey    has talked about her own teenage abuse and homelessness. But she found a niche in the news business  working as an anchor in Nashville and Baltimore  where she had her first talk show. She is now one of the most successful and wealthiest business executives  with her own network debuting in January.
 Her acting credits include an Oscar nomination for her work in ""The Color Purple."" She later produced the Broadway musical based on the ""Purple"" movie and book  and produced and starred in the film ""Beloved."" In the business world  Winfrey is credited with helping to revive the book industry with her on-air book club  which will resume this month.","[""Well  hello  Oprah!

 His decision to end the protest came after Chinese officials visited him at the airport last week -- for the first time since he started camping out.
 ""Chinese Embassy officials came to see me several times. Now they seem to acknowledge the problem "" Feng told The Associated Press from the airport terminal on his cell phone. ""I've decided to enter Japan  pull myself together and return to Shanghai for the Chinese New Year.""
 Feng has been denied entry to China eight times since June. On the last of his attempts to return  he got as far as Shanghai's Pudong airport  where Chinese officials forced him to get back on a plane for Tokyo  which arrived Nov. .
 Since then  Feng staged a peaceful protest at the airport and through his cell phone and laptop  talking to supporters and posting blogs and tweets on Twitter.
 Feng said Sunday he planned to stay with his sister  who is married to a Japanese man and lives near Tokyo  until mid-February.
 ""I believe next time I can return home "" Feng said  without elaborating. He declined to say if the embassy officials promised to guarantee his re-entry. ""As a Chinese citizen  I have a right to return home.""
 He wrote Sunday on Twitter that the Chinese officials showed their diplomatic concern ""sincerely"" and ""I will respond with sincerity as well."" He said he will formally announce his decision Tuesday before entering Japan  without giving reasons on the choice of date.
 As word of Feng's predicament spread  he became something of a celebrity  with his situation reminiscent of that in ""The Terminal "" the movie about a stateless man stuck at New York's Kennedy Airport.

4036,test,"Torry Hansen was so eager to become a mother that she adopted an older child from a foreign country  two factors that scare off many prospective parents. Her bigger fears came later.
 The family was told the boy  whose Russian name is Artyom Savelyev  was healthy in September when he was brought from the town of Partizansk in Russia's Far East to his new home in the heart of Tennessee horse country. The skinny boy seemed happy  but the behavioral problems began soon after  Hansen said.
 Hansen chronicled a list of problems: hitting  screaming and spitting at his mother and threatening to kill family members. Hansen said his eruptions were often sparked when he was denied something he wanted  like toys or video games.
 ""He drew a picture of our house burning down and he'll tell anybody that he's going to burn our house down with us in it "" she said. ""It got to be where you feared for your safety. It was terrible.""
 Hansen said she thought that with their love  they could help him. ""I was wrong "" she said.
 In February  Hansen said  the family could take no more. The boy flew into a rage  snatched a -pound (.-kilogram) statue and tried to attack his aunt with it. Hansen said he was apparently upset after his aunt asked him to correct math problems on his school work.
 Hansen bought the plane ticket  and the family arranged to pay a man in Russia $ to take him from the airport and drop him off at the Russian education ministry. He arrived alone Thursday on a United Airlines flight from Washington.
 With him was a note that read  in part: ""After giving my best to this child  I am sorry to say that for the safety of my family  friends  and myself  I no longer wish to parent this child.""
 The family  meanwhile  has rejected the Kremlin's sharp criticism and any notion that the boy was simply abandoned.
 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has called the boy's return ""the last straw"" after a string of foreign adoption failures  and officials in Moscow have called for a suspension of all U.S. adoptions in Russia -- which totaled about   last year  according to the nonprofit U.S. advocacy group the National Council For Adoption.

He was called by prosecutors to rebut the testimony of two defense mental health experts who said Rockefeller suffers from a delusional disorder and was legally insane when he took his daughter during a supervised visit last July and fled to Baltimore.
 Chu said Rockefeller  whose real name is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter  was not suffering from delusions and knew it was wrong to take his daughter. He said he based his opinion in part on evidence that Gerhartsreiter planned the kidnapping for months and later tried to conceal it.
Chu said Rockefeller  whose real name is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter  was not suffering from delusions and knew it was wrong to take his daughter. He said he based his opinion in part on evidence that Gerhartsreiter planned the kidnapping for months and later tried to conceal it.
 ""I couldn't find anything other than that he is responsible for whatever criminal activity he is charged with "" Chu said.
 He added  ""I felt that he clearly understood the wrongfulness of his conduct.""
 That conclusion is opposite what defense experts said: that Gerhartsreiter's mental health problems are so severe  he isn't responsible for actions.
 Chu said he diagnosed Gerhartsreiter with a ""mixed personality disorder"" with narcissistic and anti-social traits.
 But he rejected the defense claim that the elaborate stories he told about his past and his use of multiple aliases -- including the famous Rockefeller name -- were prompted by mental illness. Chu said the fanciful stories he told were ""creations"" and ""deliberate fabrications "" not delusions.
 Witnesses have testified that Gerhartsreiter claimed an aristocratic background and told a wide variety of stories about what he did for work  describing himself at varying times as a cardiovascular surgeon  a physicist  a ship's captain and a member of the Trilateral Commission  a private organization established in the  to foster cooperation between the United States  Europe and Japan.
 Chu said that Gerhartsreiter's answers in a -item questionnaire he gave him indicated ""a certain amount of exaggeration of symptoms.""
 For example  Chu said  when asked how often he found himself in places and had no idea how he had gotten there  Gerhartsreiter said  percent.
 ""I did not find that credible "" Chu said. If it were true  Gerhartsreiter would have trouble even functioning  Chu said.

4038,test,"A U.S. Supreme Court ruling has given former New York Republican leader Joseph L. Bruno grounds to challenge his conviction on federal mail fraud charges  but prosecutors are suggesting they may argue to have that conviction upheld as a case where his actions proven at trial amounted to a ""kickback"" scheme.
 While Bruno and his lawyers had hoped to see the Supreme Court overturn the ""honest services"" statutes used by the federal government to win a two-year prison sentence for New York's former Senate Republican leader  six of the nine justices on the high court declined to do so in their decision Thursday.
 Depending on the actions of federal prosecutors in the days and weeks ahead  the fate of Bruno    could be settled quickly  or it could be months or years. His continuing legal defense costs could be modest or become enormous.
 In Bruno's case the government did not explicitly allege that Bruno had received bribes or kickbacks  as the high court said must be shown. Instead  prosecutors focused on allegations that he had failed to disclose money-making business relationships in his annual Senate financial disclosure filings.
 Still  a definition of ""kickback"" in federal law cited by the Supreme Court in its ruling resembles many of the facts that convinced jurors to convict Bruno after his trial. Bruno received money from people or businesses that had an interest in using his legislative powers for their benefit  according to the government's case. Prosecutors had also accused the former senator of not only failing to disclose conflicts of interest  but of also violating the state's ban on gifts worth more than $.
 Bruno was convicted last December on two of eight felony counts of theft of honest services mail fraud. Jurors failed to reach a verdict on one count and acquitted Bruno on five counts. He has appealed the conviction.
 In July  Bruno abruptly resigned from the Senate position he had held for  years  including  years as Republican leader.
 The eight-count indictment handed up in January  accused Bruno of enriching himself through consulting deals with people who had an interest in his legislative decision-making.
 On May  Bruno was sentenced to two years in federal prison but allowed to remain free on his own recognizance until the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday.","['A U.S. Supreme Court ruling has given former New York Republican leader Joseph L.

 GriffinGriffin himself has thanked the BBC and hailed critics for being ""stupid"" enough to fuel a high-profile debate over whether he should be allowed on which has generated huge publicity for the BNP.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Griffin going on the show will be ""a good opportunity to expose what they are about"" while one of his ministers  Peter Hain  launched an unsuccessful bid to get him barred.
 Security at the BBC was tight ahead of Griffin's appearance  with at least  police officers on the ground  but incidents erupted hours before the show.
 Griffin says his biggest concern about the evening is ""that I might get shot on the way in""  predicting the show will be ""political bloodsport"".
 Amid the debate over whether the television exposure will boost the BNP or embarrass Griffin  he praised the broadcaster for giving him the slot.
 ""Thank you  Auntie "" he told the Times newspaper  using the BBC's nickname  adding: ""I thank the political class and their allies for being so stupid.
 In a demonstration of his ability to provoke  Griffin also used the interview to describe US President Barack Obama as an ""Afrocentric racist bigot"".
 He later wrote on his party's website that his ""Question Time"" appearance would be ""a milestone in the indomitable march of the British National Party towards saving our country.""
 Griffin added he is ""relishing"" the opportunity to ""take on the corrupt  treacherous swine destroying our beautiful island nation"". He will appear on the show alongside representatives of Britain's three main political parties.
 The BNP is now in its strongest-ever position after two of its members  including Griffin  were voted into the European Parliament.

4043,test,"The Greek debt crisis may directly affect the US economy by hitting American exports and the financial system  Atlanta Federal Reserve regional chief Dennis Lockhart warned Monday.
 He said adjustments across the European Union to fiscal problems resulting from the Greek crisis could dampen eurozone growth and constrain US exports to that region.
 The crisis could also lead to currency flows from the euro into ""safe-haven"" US dollar assets  causing an appreciation of the greenback and hurting American export competitiveness  Lockhart said.
 In addition  Lockhart said  the possibility that the Greek fiscal crisis might lead to a broad shock to financial markets ""could play out in the banking system or in the form of a general retreat from sovereign debt.""
 ""The Greek crisis might directly affect the US economy "" warned Lockhart  the first US central bank official to clearly express such concerns.
 He said that the possibilities he cited had not been factored into his  outlook so far.

 On the windswept Tibetan plateau  his closest aides look for divinations in a sacred lake. Monks scour villages for boys precocious in their spiritual attunement.
 All that is about to change  as the current Dalai Lama and his followers in exile here in India compete with the Chinese government for control of how the  Dalai LamaDalai Lama will be chosen. The issue is urgent for the Tibetans because the current Dalai Lama  the spiritual leader of all Tibetans and the charismatic face of the exile movement  has had recent bouts of ill health. He turns  in July.
 Both the Chinese and the Tibetan exiles are bracing for an almost inevitable outcome: the emergence into the world of dueling Dalai Lamas -- one chosen by the exiles  perhaps by the  Dalai Lama himself  and the other by Chinese officials.
 ""It's a huge but ultracritical issue  with no clear outcome or solution except one: trouble "" said Robert Barnett  a Tibet scholar at Columbia University. ""It is going to end up with two Dalai Lamas and thus with long-running conflict  unless the Chinese agree to a diplomatic solution pretty soon.""
 The jockeying has put the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Communist Party in surprising positions. The Dalai Lama said late last month in an interview with The New York Times that all options for choosing his reincarnation were open  including ones that break from tradition. That could mean that the next Dalai Lama would be found outside Tibet  could be a woman or might even be named while the  Dalai Lama was still alive. Meanwhile  the party  officially atheist and accused of ravaging Tibetan culture  insists that religious customs must be followed.
 Here in Dharamsala  India  where the Dalai Lama lives  religious leaders have been debating whether to bypass the traditional process.

4054,test,"Amiri arrived at the Iranian diplomatic mission in Washington this week and asked to be sent home. U.S. officials  who said Amiri had been working with the CIA for more than a year  were stunned by the decision.
 Whether the agency received an adequate return on its investment in Amiri is difficult to assess. The size of the payment might offer some measure of the value of the information he shared. But it could also reflect a level of eagerness within the U.S. intelligence community for meaningful information on Iran.
 The transfer of millions of dollars into Amiri-controlled accounts also seems to bolster the U.S. government's assertions that Amiri was neither abducted nor brought to the United States against his will.
 The scientist is not believed to have had direct access to Iran's most sensitive nuclear sites or leaders involved in decisions on whether to pursue a bomb. Still  officials said Amiri was valuable in confirming information from other sources and providing details on multiple nuclear facilities.
 Iran has already begun to take advantage of the Amiri case  with state television echoing his claims that he was abducted and describing his return as a national victory. The propaganda effort could discourage others from defecting.
 The money that went to Amiri was apparently placed in accounts or investment mechanisms that would sustain him over a lifetime in the United States. ""You basically put together a long-term benefits package "" one of the U.S. officials said.
 Although Amiri might no longer be able to access the accounts  it was not clear whether the CIA would be able to reclaim the funds. The U.S. officials declined to disclose where the funds had been deposited.
 State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley would not disclose Amiri's immigration status while he was in the United States or the reason he had been in the country. ""He was here of his own volition and left of his own volition "" Crowley said. ""If he wants to talk about this  he can.""
 The CIA's payments to Amiri add to what has become one of the more bizarre recent episodes in espionage. Amiri disappeared in Saudi Arabia last summer and then resurfaced in a series of contradictory Internet videos this spring.
 In some  he claimed to have been abducted  drugged and subjected to CIA torture to get him to talk. In another recording  apparently produced with help from the CIA  Amiri insisted that he had come to the United States of his own accord and said he was living in Tucson while pursuing a PhD.
 U.S. officials had refused to address any aspect of the case before Amiri stepped out of a taxi at the Iranian diplomatic offices in Washington this week  seeking an airline ticket back to Tehran.
 One of the U.S. officials said Amiri's family was a main factor in his decision to return. ""He just wanted to see his family and  unfortunately  he chose a dumb way to do it "" the official said  ""lying about what happened to him here to try to build up his credibility back home.""

4060,test,"Then his father recalled that when he worked at Love  a health and beauty store  he had to drag a gumball machine inside from the sidewalk every evening. ""He asked the manager what this was about  and the manager said  'This is helping pay my daughter's tuition ""' Adams said. ""So my father said to me  'How about vending machines?""'
 Prowling the Internet  Adams fell hard for the Wowie Zowie  capacity   gumballs  a machine that calls attention to itself.
 ""It's a -foot tall interactive machine "" Adams said. ""The gumball spirals  then it zigzags  rides a Ferris wheel  then drops down the chute. There's graphics  sounds. You're basically paying for the show.""
 The Wowie Zowie costs around $  new  Adams said  but he found two on eBay  for $ apiece.
 Staked by his father  he wound up buying eight. He traveled the city looking for stores that would take them in  finally placing one in a Long Island City laundromat. He recently had to take that one back -- people apparently were more interested in watching their clothes spin in the dryer than zigzagging gumballs -- but found a home for another one outside a cell-phone store in the Bronx.
 When he stocks the Wowie Zowie  salted among the gumballs are a few capsules that offer prizes -- a dollar bill  for instance  or for one lucky gum-chewer  a free cell phone. ""I pay for the cell phone "" he said. ""I figure  it's well over $  in gumballs before I'll have to shell out for a $ phone.""
 Still  the world has not beaten a path to the Wowie Zowie: Adams currently has three in his family's apartment in Harlem  and two more in storage.
 Snack and soda machines  it turned out  were much easier to place. The trunk of his Mazda is loaded with chips and drinks  and every week or so  he tends to the five machines he has at shops in the Bronx  Manhattan and Queens. He clears about $ a month from each.

4063,test,"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed Tuesday his country is now stronger than ever and warned that the Iranian military will ""cut the hand"" of anyone who dares attack the nation.
 Ahmadinejad spoke at an army parade in Tehran that showcased Iranian military might and marked the anniversary of the start of the - Iraq-Iran war. The war  launched by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein  claimed an estimated  million lives.
 Iran's military readiness is such that ""no power dares imagine an invasion against Iran "" Ahmadinejad added. ""The Iranian nation will resist all invaders.""
 Ahmadinejad is preparing to take the world stage with a speech Wednesday to the U.N. General Assembly  where he is expected to come under heavy pressure over the nuclear issue. He will likely try to deflect the controversy and cast himself as a champion of a new world order ending Western domination and providing justice for developing nations.
 Tuesday's parade speech was also meant to underline Ahmadinejad's strength in the face of a three-month domestic turmoil in which the pro-reform opposition has staged dramatic protests claiming Ahmadinejad's victory in June presidential elections was fraudulent.
 Last week  Ahmadinejad taunted Israel  questioning whether the Holocaust was ""a real event"" and calling it a pretext used by Jews to trick the West into backing the creation of Israel. On Monday  he said he was proud the remark stoked international outrage.
 At the parade  Ahmadinejad lashed out at the ""presence of foreign forces in the region"" -- meaning U.S. troops in Iraq -- and said it was ""unacceptable that some deploy troops to the region from thousands of kilometers (miles) away.""
 He accused foreign powers of creating rifts among Mideast countries while saying Iran seeks to promote brotherhood and peaceful coexistence of all nations.","['President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed Tuesday his country is now stronger than ever and warned that the Iranian military will ""cut the hand"" of anyone who dares attack the nation.', ' Ahmadinejad spoke at an army parade in Tehran that showcased Iranian military might and marked the anniversary of the start of the - Iraq-Iran war.

The complaint contends that UBS's participation allowed for more than $ billion to be funneled to Madoff -- even as the bank knew a fraud was afoot and took steps to protect itself against liability if Madoff's firm went under.
 UBS and its affiliates ""chose to enable Madoff's fraud for their own gain "" netting more than $ million in fees by administering the feeder funds Luxalpha and Groupement Financier. The bank's involvement provided the funds a ""facade of legitimacy "" according to the complaint.

Madoff himself is serving a -year sentence in federal prison.
 Instead  UBS made Madoff's firm the subcustodian for the assets held by the feeder funds. That  according to the complaint  had the effect of allowing Madoff to value his own funds and manipulate reports as needed to cover up his scheme.
 Smith  the UBS spokeswoman  said that Luxalpha was clearly defined as existing for the purpose of channeling investments to Madoff and that the fund's documentation contained an explicit waiver that USB was ""not expected to be responsible for the safekeeping of the assets.""
 ""UBS does not have responsibility to these shareholders for the unfortunate results of the Madoff scandal "" she said.

 Union leader Juan Barahona  one of Zelaya's top three negotiators  told a rally of hundreds of the president's followers that the joint cabinet  if indeed formed  would be made up of ministers from both governments.
 The formation of a national unity government and amnesty for crimes linked to the coup were two key points of the San Jose reconciliation agenda set out in August  whose central tenet calls for Zelaya's return to office.
 The resumption of talks on Tuesday will come just two days before the October  deadline given by the Zelaya camp for his unconditional return to power.

 Maradona  the Argentine coach  had Saturday's match moved from the capital  Buenos Aires  to a more intimate stadium here. He took the team to church on Thursday  to pray.
 That possibility is almost too much to bear for many Argentines. In a country of few living heroes  the -year-old Maradona is a flawed character  a recovering substance abuser who struggled with the trappings of stardom. But time and again  Argentines forgave his faults because of his undeniable brilliance on the soccer field  his almost divinelike inspiration at times.
 Now his failures as a coach are threatening to sully his legend as perhaps the world's best-ever player.
 ""I admired him as a player  he is a god for us "" said a dejected Jorge Rodriguez    as he left Rosario's stadium. ""But Maradona is not a coach; it doesn't work. He showed that tonight. We have some of the best players in the world  and they showed us nothing. They are lacking order  discipline  everything. They need a coach.""

 The playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme quit the team over remarks he saw as critical of his playing style by Maradona and reporters. In April  Argentina lost to struggling Bolivia  -. Maradona blamed mostly the high altitude of La Paz for the defeat. But a loss at Ecuador cemented fears that Maradona was out of his depth.
 It went on to win the  World Cup in Mexico. In that tournament  Maradona shone on the field  scoring one memorable goal against England and another with his hand  which the referee apparently never saw. Afterward  Maradona famously told the news media that he scored the goal in part with his head and in part with ""the hand of God.""
 In   after Argentina failed to qualify outright  Maradona was called up to help the national side clinch a spot. Argentina had to play two matches against Australia. In the first match in Sydney  Maradona set up the Argentine goal in a - tie. In Buenos Aires  the Argentines won  -.
 ""Normally  this part is much worse for the team than the Cup itself "" said Sergio Levinsky  an Argentine who wrote the book ""Maradona: Rebel With a Cause.""
 Since taking over as the coach  Maradona has focused on changing the climate around the team. He goes to the players' homes  and he calls them on the phone. In a bid to further inspire the team  he pushed to move the match on Saturday to Rosario  where the fans would be closer to the field and where Messi  who grew up in the city  would be surrounded by friends and family.
 ""None of what he has done has anything to do with tactics "" Levinsky said.
 To try to address Maradona's lack of experience  Grondona assigned Carlos Bilardo  the coach of the  World Cup-winning team  to serve as an assistant. But Maradona has limited the -year-old Bilardo's input  not allowing him to eat with the players or make personnel decisions  Levinsky said.
 Argentina will next face Paraguay  which is tied for second place  on Wednesday in Asuncion. Matches with Peru in Argentina and with Uruguay in Montevideo will be Maradona's last chances to save face -- and not be remembered as the coach who failed to reach the Cup for the first time in  years.

4067,test,"Honduras' interim government suggested that backers of ousted President Manuel Zelaya were taking up arms to return him to power and it reinstated an overnight curfew it had lifted only days earlier.
 A day earlier  Zelaya said Hondurans have the right to launch an insurrection against an illegitimate government -- referring to a clause in the country's constitution -- and warned he would pull out of talks to solve the crisis if the interim government does not quickly leave.
 ""There are reports  I don't know if they are real  I haven't been officially informed  that there is a group of armed people and that Zelaya is going to enter over the Nicaraguan border this Saturday "" said Micheletti  the former congressional leader who was sworn in to serve out the final six months of Zelaya's term following the June  coup.
 Earlier Wednesday  Micheletti offered to step down ""if at some point that decision is needed to bring peace and tranquility to the country."" But he said that hinged on guarantees that Zelaya would not return to power.
 Zelaya was not immediately available for comment  but the offer appeared unlikely to resolve the crisis over the coup  in which soldiers seized Zelaya and hustled him out of the country on a plane.
 If Micheletti were to resign  under Honduran law the presidency would pass to Supreme Court President Jorge Rivera. The Supreme Court backed the coup  ruling that Zelaya had violated the law by attempting to hold a vote about whether to write a new constitution.
 Many Hondurans viewed the proposed vote as an attempt by Zelaya  an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez  to end a ban on re-election and pave the way for his return to power.
 Zelaya denies he was seeking another term.
 The interim president has threatened to jail Zelaya  a wealthy rancher who shifted to the left after being elected  if he comes back to Honduras.
 Demonstrations for Zelaya's return continued in Tegucigalpa on Wednesday and his supporters called for labor strikes.
 Labor leader Israel Salinas  one of the main figures in the pro-Zelaya movement  told thousands of demonstrators who marched through the capital that workers at state-owned companies plan walkouts later this week.","[""Honduras' interim government suggested that backers of ousted President Manuel Zelaya were taking up arms to return him to power and it reinstated an overnight curfew it had lifted only days earlier."", "" A day earlier  Zelaya said Hondurans have the right to launch an insurrection against an illegitimate government -- referring to a clause in the country's constitution -- and warned he would pull out of talks to solve the crisis if the interim government does not quickly leave."", ' ""There are reports  I don\'t know if they are real  I haven\'t been officially informed  that there is a group of armed people and that Zelaya is going to enter over the Nicaraguan border this Saturday "" said Micheletti  the former congressional leader who was sworn in to serve out the final six months of Zelaya\'s term following the June  coup.', ' Earlier Wednesday  Micheletti offered to step down ""if at some point that decision is needed to bring peace and tranquility to the country.""

 Had she been prosecuted in state court  Bond would most likely have faced a sentence of three months to two years  her lawyers say. In federal court  she got six years.
 Bond's argument on appeal was that Congress did not have the constitutional power to use a chemical weapons treaty to address a matter of a sort routinely handled by state authorities.
 A unanimous three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Philadelphia said Bond's argument was a serious one of ""first impression."" Then the court ducked answering the question by saying Bond was not entitled to raise it. Only states  it said  can mount  Amendment challenges.
 Paul D. Clement  a solicitor general in the administration of President George W. Bush  now represents Bond. He called the idea that Bond lacks standing to challenge the law under which she was imprisoned ""startling"" and ""absurd.""
 More broadly  Clement wrote  the Bond case is an instance of an issue that has lately united conservatives  libertarians and liberals. They say there are too many federal crimes  that they are often simultaneously vague and harsh  and that they undermine state authority to maintain public safety.

 ""A criminal defendant has standing to defend herself by arguing that the statute under which she is being prosecuted was beyond Congress' Article I authority to enact "" Acting Solicitor General Neal K. Katyal told the justices.

While India says that  Jadhav  is a retired Indian navy official  the Pakistan government has been describing  him  as a serving officer.
During the meeting   Jadhav  was seen sitting behind a glass screen in the Pakistani Foreign Office while  his  mother and wife sat on the other side. They spoke through an intercom for nearly  minutes.
"" Kulbhushan Jadhav  is an established terrorist and  his  family was allowed to meet with  him  purely on humanitarian grounds ""  he  told reporters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.
 The Indian minister  said the Pakistani press was allowed on multiple occasions to approach family members closely  harass and hector them and hurl accusations about Jadhav.  She  said this was despite a clear agreement between the two sides that the media would not be allowed close access.

4074,test,"The top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is calling on the committee to look into a whistleblower's claims that during President Trump's inauguration speech  then-national security adviser Michael Flynn texted a former business associate to say a private nuclear reactor plan involving Russia and Saudi Arabia that  Flynn  had lobbied for would have  his  support in the White House.
Ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings  D-Maryland  wrote to chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy  R-South Carolina  Wednesday  pointing out Gowdy previously ""refused"" to press the White House on bipartisan document requests and ""disregarded"" evidence about  Flynn 's efforts to work with Russia on a plan to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia  urging him now to request subpoenas related to the emails and texts concerning  Flynn 's suspected activities.
As the whistleblower chatted with  Flynn 's associate at an Inauguration Day celebration on Jan.    Flynn  reportedly sent text messages saying the associate's nuclear proposal was ""good to go "" the whistleblower said  according to Cummings. According to the whistleblower   Flynn  also informed the associate that  his  business partners would be able to move forward with their project  which aimed to construct a network of nuclear reactors across the Mideast with support from Russian and other international interests.
While  Flynn 's agreement last week to plead guilty and cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation largely insulates the retired lieutenant general from further legal jeopardy  the whistleblower's allegations raise new concerns about the extent to which  Flynn  may have blurred  his  private and public interests during  his  brief stint inside the White House. Mr. Trump fired  Flynn  in February  saying he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S.
Cummings said Wednesday that the whistleblower's allegations raise concerns that  Flynn  improperly aided the nuclear project after joining the White House as one of Trump's top national security officials. The project has yet to get off the ground.
Cummings detailed the whistleblower's allegations in his letter to Gowdy  and urged Gowdy to authorize subpoenas to  Flynn  and  his  business associates to learn more about  his  efforts to aid the proposal. Gowdy did not immediately respond to Associated Press requests for comment but previously has referred letters from House Democrats about  Flynn  to Mueller's inquiry.
 Flynn  had been a paid consultant for the venture before  he  joined the Trump campaign last year. The plan  backed by a group of investors  nuclear power adherents and former U.S. military officers  was to construct dozens of nuclear reactors across the Mideast working with Russian and other international private interests.
Copson had promoted a succession of nuclear projects designed to include Russian participation dating back to the . In an earlier note to the committee  Copson said his firm had provided  Flynn  with a $  check — left un-cashed — and paid for  Flynn 's June  trip to the Mideast as a security consultant for the project.
 Flynn 's financial disclosure did not cite those payments  but  he  did report that until December    he  worked as an adviser to two other companies that partnered with Copson's firm. That consortium  X-Co Dynamics Inc. and Iron Bridge Group  initially worked with ACU but later pushed a separate nuclear proposal for the Mideast.","[""The top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is calling on the committee to look into a whistleblower's claims that during President Trump's inauguration speech  then-national security adviser Michael Flynn texted a former business associate to say a private nuclear reactor plan involving Russia and Saudi Arabia that  Flynn  had lobbied for would have  his  support in the White House."", 'Ranking member Rep.

4076,test,"The inspector general for the Interior Department has opened an investigation into  Secretary Ryan Zinke’s  travel during seven months in office  from his use of taxpayer-funded charter and military planes to his mixing of official trips with political appearances.
Nancy K. DiPaolo  a spokesperson for Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall  described a broad investigation into  Zinke ’s “travel in general ” including “modes of travel  costs and schedules.”

The flight cost taxpayers $   according to an Interior Department spokeswoman. Commercial airlines run daily flights between the two airports and charge as little as $.  Zinke ’s spokeswoman  Heather Swift  said no commercial flight was available that would have worked with his schedule that night.
 Zinke  appeared at an event held by a major campaign donor  giving a motivational speech at a dinner for the Las Vegas Golden Knights  a hockey team owned by Bill Foley  the chairman of Fidelity National Financial. Employees and PACs associated with the financial services company have given close to $  to  Zinke ’s past congressional campaigns.
“Claims that the Secretary’s full schedule required the use of chartered aircraft deserve scrutiny ” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Kendall last week. “It appears as though Secretary  Zinke  and  his  staff could have taken a commercial flight from Las Vegas to Montana if  he  did not attend the motivational speech to the hockey team owned by  his  friend and campaign contributor.”
 Zinke  was in the Las Vegas area that day after flying on a commercial Southwest Airlines jet from Reno  Nev.  where  he  spoke the night before at a nearby dinner in Lake Tahoe held by the Rule of Law Defense Fund  a conservative group of attorneys general backed by the Koch brothers.
Just before the Golden Knights dinner   Zinke  had appeared in the tiny rural Nevada town of Pahrump to announce a routine local funding grant from Congress to rural communities. It was one of several official trips that coincided with weekends  Zinke  spent at  his  homes in Santa Barbara  Calif.  and Montana.
The secretary and  his  official entourage also boarded private flights between the Caribbean islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix during a three-day trip to the Virgin Islands in March   his  first month on the job.
 Swift  said  Zinke ’s charter flights were authorized by ethics officials and booked only when feasible commercial flights were unavailable.  She  said previous interior secretaries flew charter flights when needed.
The watchdog group Campaign for Accountability also requested an investigation into whether  Zinke  violated the federal Hatch Act by speaking to the hockey team as part of his official duties. The act prevents executive branch employees from engaging in partisan political activity.
It is unclear whether taxpayers paid the costs of  Zinke’s  political appearances.
In remarks on American energy independence at the Heritage Foundation last Friday   Zinke  called the media scrutiny “a little B.S.” and defended flights he has taken on military and charter aircraft since he took office.
 Zinke  did not mention the costs of those flights or whether staffers traveled with  him .  Zinke  also said that  he  has flown U.S. military jets at least twice  once at the invitation of Agriculture Department Secretary Sonny Perdue and again at the invitation of President Trump.

4078,test,"Joseph Caltabiano  the former vice president of mortgage lending at Guaranteed Rate   left the Chicago-based company in November and joined rival BeMortgage.  Caltabiano ’s lawsuit alleges that  he  left  in part  because Guaranteed Rate executives were manipulating and misreporting financial information for their own benefit.
 Caltabiano  filed the suit Dec.  in Cook County Circuit Court in response to a lawsuit  his  former employer filed against  him  last month. Guaranteed Rate’s earlier lawsuit alleges  Caltabiano  planned and participated in an exodus of more than  employees to BeMortgage  a mortgage lender that operates as a division of Bridgeview Bank Group.
“Guaranteed Rate has a history of pursuing legal courses after somebody departs ” Caltabiano  who had been with  the company  about  years  said in an interview. “We felt this was the best course of action to both vindicate myself of their alleged charges and point out some items that I’m owed compensation for.”
 Caltabiano  was responsible for closing more than $ million in loans this year  according to  his  lawsuit. Guaranteed Rate had agreed to pay  him  twice a month in commissions plus bonuses  but it allegedly failed to do so for the pay period after  his  resignation  according to the lawsuit.
There were other instances in which Guaranteed Rate allegedly failed to pay  Caltabiano   including an agreed upon issuance of stock options  his lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit alleges that they were underreporting the gain on sale  or the amount of revenue made on a loan when it’s closed compared with when it’s sold to an investor. The executives then allegedly were able to pocket revenue from the actual gain on sale instead of paying  Caltabiano  and others their full compensation  the suit says.
The manipulations allegedly occurred over the past decade and have led to “a flurry of” resignations by executives  loan officers and others this year  according to  Caltabiano ’s lawsuit.
“Unfortunately  when you lose trust in a company  that’s a very difficult place to work ”  Caltabiano  said.","['Joseph Caltabiano  the former vice president of mortgage lending at Guaranteed Rate   left the Chicago-based company in November and joined rival BeMortgage.

 A post shared by Melissa Rivers (@melissariversofficial) on Aug    at : PDT
""Scott  kept saying to  me   ‘There’s something in here… There’s a book here.’ And I was like  ‘Oh God  no there’s not.’ And he kept on me  convincing me. And I said  ‘Fine. If you can put something together and prove to me that there’s a book here then I’ll think about it. And he put something together…  sent it to my agent and it sold in a day.”
When asked if going through her mother’s belongings helped her cope with the loss   Melissa  joked  “I’m not sure the book helped me cope  but it certainly helped get my storage bills under control.”
While  Melissa  wasn’t surprised by the discovery  as it was far from a family secret  fans will be shocked to learn that Joan  who was recognized as one of America’s most successful female stand-up comics  originally dreamed of a different role for herself.
“…The message that came back to my mom was ‘It doesn’t hurt me where I live ’” said  Melissa . “Which is a pretty incredible answer. And as we saw the things that  she  did later in life  you get that.  She  always knew who  she  was  regardless of everything that was swirling around  her .""
And while some of Joan’s infamous jokes could have easily offended  her  targets   Melissa  insisted  she  was never out to hurt anyone. And if Joan was aware that any of  her  subjects or their families were genuinely upset by  her  puns   she  would immediately remove them from  her  act.
“You look at the bulk of the material  and I would say a good  percent is self-deprecating with  her  as the butt of the joke ” said  Melissa . “Everyone used to ask if it would upset my dad (TV producer Edgar Rosenberg) that  she  made so many jokes about my dad. And my mom would always say  ‘You aren’t listening carefully. The jokes aren’t about Edgar. The jokes are about me!’… It was making fun of herself… She was never intent on hurting anyone.”
But Joan easily gained both fame and famous fans  including former President Ronald Reagan and Prince Charles.  Melissa  explained humor was the reason behind their lasting friendships.
“President Reagan was funny ” said  Melissa . “You forget  he was an actor and a great storyteller… And my mother’s dear friend was Nancy Reagan.

4089,test,"Rahul Gandhi  the -year-old scion of India's Nehru-Gandhi family   takes the helm of the National Congress Party this week  raising questions about the potency of the political opposition in the world's biggest democracy.
 Rahul  succeeds  his  mother  Sonia Gandhi    who steps down amid concerns of ill health  and ends a record  years as party president.
 Rahul Gandhi  is seen as a sweet-tempered young man  but a neophyte  more party mascot than savvy political boss. It's been said that  he  has neither the charisma of  his  grandmother   Indira Gandhi   nor the intellect of  his  great-grandfather  Jawaharlal Nehru  India's first prime minister.
Mander says in the face of such intimidation  it's critical for the opposition to find its voice. While he says he's willing to give  Rahul Gandhi  a chance   he  worries that  he  will ""continue to be advised to be cautious"" and pursue a more ambiguous stand.  Gandhi  has been criticized for playing to the BJP's Hindutva strengths  paying visits to an unusual number of Hindu temples during the campaign in Gujarat.
 Gandhi  was the only candidate for the party's top post  a nomination  he  won unanimously. Critics condemn the Congress party's dynastic character; Modi rode to office deriding the party as out of touch and undemocratic  and handed Congress the biggest loss in its -year history.
But Neelanjan Sircar  a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi  says the Congress party has no real mechanism to move ground level leaders up the ranks. In addition  he says competing factions within the Congress party could tear it apart. Although  Gandhi  may not be ideal  Sircar says it may be difficult to hold the party together without him.
But expecting a relatively young  Gandhi  to be a magnet for the youth vote may disappoint. Many of India's young reject politics that smacks of elitism and exclusion. Inheriting political office or consolidating power around one family offends their sense of meritocracy.
 Rahul Gandhi  has been sharpening  his  skills for the thrust and parry of Indian politics.

4093,test,"“That’s the white graveyard ” Cyril Chandler    said  gesturing with a scarred hand injured in a printing press accident decades ago. “This is the black one on the other side.” Cyril then guided me to the small stone obelisk marking the grave of his great-grandfather  Silas Chandler  a former slave who went to war alongside his Confederate master and a man who in death has become a source of controversy he could never have imagined. The Confederate flag that once flew at his resting place is gone  as is the metal cross placed there by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy in a  ceremony to honor his “service ” complete with a -gun salute. According to the SCV  the cross was not an award for valor or bravery  but simply denoted that  Silas  was a Confederate soldier.
The ceremony was a reunion of sorts between the two  Chandler  families  white and black. Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr.  a great-grandson of Silas’s master  said at the time that reconnecting with  Bobbie Chandler      Silas ’s great-grandson  was “truly as if I had been reunited with a missing part of my family.” Although Bobbie and  Cyril Chandler  were both present  their other siblings refused to attend the event. They wanted no part of the ceremony  or the implication that  Silas  had served the Confederate cause willingly. Myra Chandler Sampson    Silas's great-granddaughter  began researching  Silas ’s life and concluded he was no soldier  but a slave. Sampson  along with other family members  in  signed a petition letter  which was later published on the website of Kevin M. Levin  a historian who has spent countless hours rebutting tales of black Confederates — and the story of Silas Chandler in particular. The letter calls the honors laid at  Silas ’s grave “a great insult to  Silas  and all of  his  descendants.” “We didn't like that Confederate flag bein' on his gravesite and we didn't like that iron cross ” said Sara Wims    another of one of  Silas ’s granddaughters. This much the two  Chandler  families can agree on:  Silas Chandler  was there when  his  master  Confederate Sgt. Andrew  Chandler   was gravely wounded at the  Battle of Chickamauga in Tennessee.  Silas  helped  his  injured master return home  saving Andrew’s leg from amputation. This story might have remained  like many others  just another Civil War tale passed down from one generation to the next  if it weren’t for an astonishing tintype of the two men  armed to the teeth in Confederate uniforms  taken in . The image has helped bolster the claims of the community of amateur historians  hucksters  and Confederate sympathizers committed to defending the Confederacy from the charge of racism  who insist that thousands of black men fought and died for the rebel cause. “Ever since the SCV posthumously honored Silas ” Levin wrote in   “accounts of black Confederate troops have surged in popularity.” It is a community that has grown more vocal and irate as black and white activists have successfully sought to strip Confederate emblems from places of honor around the country. After the massacre of nine black parishioners in South Carolina by a white supremacist  the South Carolina SCV defended the Confederate flag then flying on the state capitol grounds by invoking “Black Confederate soldiers” who “fought in the trenches beside their White brothers.” In this community  the two Chandlers  master and slave  have become icons of Southern virtue  proof of the benign nature of the Confederacy and the harmonious antebellum relationship between blacks and whites. Confederate websites like Dixie Outfitters sell merchandise celebrating the “Chandler Boys” and their battle-forged friendship. Here  they say  is proof that the cause of the Confederacy was not slavery  not the eternal gospel of white supremacy  but freedom. After all  how could a racist society have inspired such loyalty from its black subjects?
More than  years after Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House  our perception of the Civil War and its aftermath still shapes Americans' understanding of racism. The saga of the two Chandler families is no different  except that the finer points about Andrew and Silas — fogged by the passage of time  the fallibility of memory  and simple family loyalties — are more difficult to parse. “It is not difficult to speculate that as a result of sharing these very trying life experiences that a special bond existed between  ” wrote Battaile Sr. in Black Southerners in Gray  a  anthology containing essays testifying to the existence of thousands of black Confederate soldiers. He also wrote that he hoped to meet more of Silas’s descendants and “renew the bonds that existed between our ancestors.” The cover of the anthology bears the iconic image of Andrew and Silas. But where Andrew Chandler’s descendants recall an intimate friendship that lasted for generations  and neo-Confederates see evidence of a post-racial Confederacy   Silas Chandler’s  family sees a slave forced to serve a cause  he  did not believe in  not only in life but also in death. “ They  dressed  him  up like a monkey ” Sampson said  “and took  him  off to war.”
 Silas Chandler’s   pension application would seem to settle the issue of whether  he  was slave or free: the  line asks about the “vessel in which your owner served.” But then there’s that tintype.
Andrew sits with a face like stone  sword resting on his shoulder  a pistol in his hand and one in his belt.  Silas  sits slightly lower than Andrew  an inscrutable expression on  his  face: Amusement? Resignation? Happiness? Determination?  He  carries a smaller knife and the tail end of a shotgun draped across their legs. They are both in uniform  therefore they must both be soldiers  comrades  equals. How could anything else be true? Andrew M. Chandler's family recalls the two men as not having a typical master and slave relationship. “Andrew Martin and  Silas  kind of grew up together and were crawling around on the kitchen floor as children ” Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. said. “And they hunted and fished and grew up as young boys together.” According to his pension application   Silas  was born in   seven years before Andrew  and was one of  slaves owned by the Chandlers. Mississippi seceded in January   declaring  “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery ” and decrying the Northern states’ supposed designs on “negro equality.” At the time  almost half of Mississippi’s white population owned slaves  and slaves made up a majority of the state’s population. The iconic photo was taken some time after Andrew took  Silas  to war later that year. Both families recall  Silas  being the line of communication between battlefield and family  transporting messages and supplies back and forth. Andrew's regiment fought through some of the toughest battles of the Western Theater of the Civil War  and Andrew was captured at the Battle of Shiloh in April . According to a letter Levin provided to BuzzFeed News  Andrew wrote to his mother  Louisa  in August  worried that  Silas  could end up in Union hands. “If the Feds were to capture him  they might take him along with them ” Andrew wrote. Andrew’s concern about  Silas ’s capture could be interpreted as concern for a dear friend. But it could have just as easily been fear of losing his property. That month  President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Second Confiscation Act  freeing all slaves owned by Confederate soldiers. If the “Feds” had “captured” Silas  he’d be a free man. In September    Andrew Chandler  and  his  regiment  the  Mississippi Infantry  were part of the Confederate forces under Gen. Braxton Bragg that routed Maj. General William Rosecrans’s Union forces at the Battle of Chickamauga. The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war  with   casualties on the Union side and more than   on the Confederate side. The  suffered greatly  with nearly % of the -soldier regiment killed or injured. Andrew was shot in the leg during the battle. Family legend has it that the Confederate surgeon recommended amputation  and  Silas   using a gold coin sewn into his jacket for emergencies  bought a crate of whiskey to bribe the surgeon to let him take Andrew away. He managed to smuggle Andrew onto a boxcar to Atlanta. Genealogy notes passed down by Andrew’s family contain the recollections of Mary Ivy  Chandler   Andrew’s daughter. Mary Ivy says in the notes that Andrew’s uncle   Kyle Chandler   was waiting in Atlanta with a carriage and a nurse to bring Andrew and  Silas  back.
A Confederate medical document from  uncovered by PBS confirms the story of Andrew’s injury  showing a gunshot wound to his right leg and ankle at Chickamauga  but nothing beyond family lore supports the gold coin story — neither Mary Ivy’s account nor his obituary in Confederate Veteran magazine mentions it. ""I never heard that story  until  Silas  came to the forefront on the internet  after the story that was built up to put that iron cross on  his  grave ” said Myra. ""I never heard that from my grandfather; I never heard that from my father. I never believed that they would have given a slave money."" In fact  the genealogy notes raise the possibility that it may have been Kyle  not Silas  who got the whiskey  and for the hometown doctor rather than the army surgeon. “Uncle Kyle paid the doctor $ a day for his services in caring for Papa  and that was what one quart of whiskey cost him ” Mary Ivy says in the notes. “I often wonder if the whiskey was for patients or if the doctor drank it.” Regardless  Andrew’s leg was saved  although it would never again work properly.  Silas  was sent back off to war as a servant for Andrew’s younger brother  Benjamin Chandler  in the  Mississippi Cavalry. Battaile Sr. believes  Silas  served the Chandler family out of loyalty. “I don't think it was something that  he  seriously objected to  because  he  had freedom to go back and forth and travel at will ”  he  said. “If  he  had been totally against it   he  could have run away at any time  I'm sure.”  Silas 's family members recall that relationship  and the iconic photograph of the two men  very differently. “The Confederates always  that  he  could’ve run away any time   he  always returned ” said Myra. “ He  always returned because  he  had a wife and  his  first son  William Henry  was born while  he  was off at war ... That’s why  he  never ran away.”
Nelson W. Winbush  a black member of the SCV from Tennessee  told anyone who would listen that his grandfather  “private” Louis Napoleon Nelson  was a Confederate soldier fighting under Nathan Bedford Forrest  the first national leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Nelson’s pension records actually list him as a “cook” and “servant.” An example of a black Confederate soldier that Allen provided to BuzzFeed News was Holt Collier  a Mississippi man whose biography from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identifies him as having “joined the Confederacy” to become a “sharpshooter” and “military spy.” Collier’s pension records identify him as a slave. None of these stories  however  have anything like the arresting tintype of Andrew and Silas Chandler  an image that seems to embody fantasies of the post-racial Confederacy  which explains why to this day those testifying to the existence of black Confederates invoke their image. As recently as January the Richmond Times-Dispatch published a syndicated column invoking the myth of black Confederates featuring the photograph of  Silas  and Andrew. Myra Chandler said that her father  Silas’s grandson  went to his grave angry that  Silas ’s image had been used to perpetuate a myth. “ He  knew that  Silas  was not a soldier —  he  was a slave ” Myra said. “And  he  knew that  he  was being used to promote something that was false.”
Confederate heritage organizations were first alerted to the story of Andrew and  Silas  in the early  when Bobbie Chandler   Silas ’s great-grandson  gave a copy of the famous photo to the Washington Times for a story. Bobbie worked there as a production manager.
“We had employees donating different things and I donated the story of  Silas  ” Bobbie said. “That’s what started everything.” The Washington Times story led to the reunion between the descendants of the two men  and drew the attention of the UDC and SCV  which culminated in the  ceremony at  Silas ’s grave. The original tintype might have remained hidden  but for Andrew Chandler Battaile Jr.’s decision to have it appraised on a  episode of Antiques Roadshow on PBS. “They're about the same age  joined the Confederate Army when Andrew was    Silas  was   and they fought in four battles together ” Chandler Battaile Jr. told the appraiser  Wes Cowan  on Antiques Roadshow. Cowan estimated the value of the photograph at $  to $ . “It's very interesting to learn more about it  and I'm honored to be able to steward this on behalf of my family and Bobbie's family ” Andrew Battaile Jr. told Cowan  who emphasized the rarity of seeing a contemporary image from the Civil War of a black man in Confederate uniform. “It’s the only one of its kind ” said Tom Liljenquist  a prominent Civil War photo collector whose name is featured on a collection at the Library of Congress. “How many pictures have you seen of a Confederate soldier with his slave? There aren’t any.” The Antiques Roadshow episode spurred an episode of History Detectives  with Cowan seeking to determine the nature of the relationship between Andrew Chandler and Silas Chandler.
“According to their family story  the Chandlers granted  Silas   his  freedom just before the war and that  he  fought heroically alongside  his  former master in the  Mississippi Regiment ” Cowan noted on History Detectives. (Battaile Jr. told BuzzFeed News that  he  first heard  Silas  might have been a soldier from Bobbie Chandler. Bobbie says  he  first heard  Silas  might have been a soldier from a write-up in the neo-Confederate publication Southern Partisan.) It’s unclear where this piece of family lore that  Silas  was freed crept in — the  newspaper article about their relationship during the war describes  Silas  as Andrew’s slave. Cowan proved that  Silas  was a slave through  his  pension records  that  he  had not been set free or bought  his  freedom prior to the war and that the Chandler family had not donated the land upon which  Silas  founded a church for former slaves after the war. The weapons in the famous photograph were props likely given to them just for the picture. “I think it’s interesting to understand the place of stories in family histories. Obviously  the story that we’ve shared is one that is very comfortable  and comforting to believe ” Battaile Jr. told Cowan. “But without documentary evidence  it is a story. Our families’ histories have been  and will always be  deeply intertwined and evolving with the times.” The episode seemed to show the Chandler families united  as they appeared to be the warm  rainy day that the SCV and UDC laid honors at  Silas ’s grave in . Bobbie and Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. were both there  representing Andrew and  Silas   seemingly reconciled. Myra Chandler Sampson  in the meantime  was frustrated because the episode confirmed what she had discovered through her research:  Silas  was no Confederate soldier.
The discoveries on History Detectives upended stories that both families had told for years. Andrew Chandler’s family believed  Silas  had been freed and had therefore joined the Confederate cause willingly  and  Silas ’s family believed that  Silas   a talented carpenter  had bought his freedom through money he earned by doing odd jobs on the side in West Point  Mississippi. Neither story could possibly be true — Mississippi outlawed manumission of slaves  and after emancipation there would have been no need for manumission.  Silas ’s family had always believed  he  had bought  his  own freedom. The realization that  he  couldn’t have made  Silas ’s grandson believe that  Silas  had been “tricked” into buying a freedom that had already been purchased in blood. “My father believes that  Silas  was already freed when he bought his freedom ” said Myra Chandler Sampson of her father   Silas’s  grandson. “And they took his money  and let him think that he bought his freedom.”
Today West Point is still a mostly black town of about    dotted with aging memorials to the Confederate States of America. Cyril Chandler moved back in the  to live in the home built by  Silas ’s son in the same place where  Silas  once built his own dwelling  across the street from the church  Silas  founded.  Silas ’s name is carved into the cornerstone.  Silas  and  his  wife  Lucy  had  children  and  he  taught  his  sons to shoot and to build  lessons that were passed down through the generations.  He  taught them to rely on  and defend  themselves.
“My granddaddy   he  always bragged on the fact that  he  could shoot a squirrel's eye out as  he 's climbin' up a tree ”  Silas 's great-granddaughter Sara Wims said with a laugh. “People around the town  a lot of times there were some whites that were not so nice — they knew that  he  would shoot those guns at any time.”
Battaile Sr. said  Silas  remained close to the family after the war. “My mother knew  him  very well ”  he  said. "" He  used to take her fishing and picnicking and things like that.  He  stayed close to the family after the war and after emancipation.” Nevertheless  the families connected rarely as time went on. The Chandler Battailes moved elsewhere  while the descendants of Kyle Chandler  Andrew’s uncle  remained in West Point. Sara Wims recalled a Chandler family reunion near or in West Point in which  Silas ’s son  her grandfather  George Chandler  was invited. (Neither Kyle Chandler III nor Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. recalled the family reunion.) “I was about   and they invited my grandfather to come to tell them about  Silas  ” said Sara. ""But they wanted  him  to bring me along  since I was   so that I could babysit the kids that were there. At that time  my grandfather wouldn't hear of it.” George  she said  refused to sit at a table with Andrew Chandler’s family  despite being invited to do so. “Maybe  he  had been so conditioned that  he  didn't feel as if  he  should be a part of the family as much as sitting with them to eat.” The interactions between the families were not all fraught. Bobbie Chandler recalled that  when their home burned down when he was a child  the descendants of Kyle Chandler living in West Point helped out financially  donating money to build a new house. (Kyle Chandler III said he did not remember if his family had helped out Bobbie’s.)
Silas Chandler’s grandchildren grew up in a segregated West Point full of paradoxes.  Silas ’s labors had left them better off than many of their white neighbors  who were friendly when no one was around but denigrated them when other whites were present. They went to a private all-black Presbyterian school instead of the local segregated one. “After school we used to get out there with the white kids and play ball ” said Bobbie. “A couple times they had people come by and say  'The white kids and the black kids are not supposed to play ball together.’” Myra’s recollection is a bit harsher. “They were only friends with us when they were around us — for sure we played with them. I even took a bath with the little girl  she was my friend ” Myra said. “But outside of our neighborhood  we were niggers. So that’s the way that was.” Most of the black Chandlers moved away from West Point  except for Cyril  who moved back in  after college and started his own printing business. After going to Howard University  Sara moved to Detroit to raise her children. Myra was a schoolteacher in California until she retired years ago. Bobbie and his brother Jimmy ran a printing business together for  years in Washington  D.C. (A sixth sibling  George  moved to Chicago  where he worked in a metal refinery. He died last year.) Though they mostly lost touch with Andrew Chandler’s family before the ceremony in   state documents show at least one of his descendants  Kyle Chandler II — from the same family that Bobbie said helped out when Bobbie’s home burned down — was a member of the White Citizens’ Councils in West Point in the late   an organization dedicated to preserving white supremacy. Kyle is named as a member of the council in a document that identifies George Chandler   Silas ’s son  as one of the members of the black community who might be “members of the NAACP and potential troublemakers in the event of a racial crisis.” (Battaile Sr. described Kyle as a “distant cousin ” Kyle Chandler III seemed surprised and dismayed by the information about his father  Kyle Chandler II.) Bobbie said that he has a “good relationship” with the Chandler Battailes  and that they used to go out to dinner together when he visited Mississippi  but haven’t spoken in years. Once it became clear that  Silas  was a slave  not a soldier  Bobbie and Cyril decided they agreed with the rest of the family and didn’t want the Confederate honors at  Silas ’s grave. “I’m glad that the Confederate flag was moved off of  his  grave  and I’m glad that the Confederate flag has been removed from the state capitol and things like that  in some states ” said Bobbie. “I made a mistake.” The cross was stolen  and though Confederate flags continued to be placed at  Silas ’s resting place  those would disappear too. Sometimes Cyril would take them  sometimes someone else. As for the tintype  Bobbie told BuzzFeed News that Andrew Chandler’s family had agreed to split the money with them if it was sold. ""I never did receive any of that ” he said. Andrew Chandler Battaile Jr. — who today works for the foundation that preserves Stratford Hall  the ancestral home of the family of Robert E. Lee — says there was no such agreement  despite the fact that the value of the photograph is due to  Silas ’s presence in it. “I never heard of such an agreement  no ” Battaile Jr. said. The tintype was sold to Liljenquist  the collector  for an undisclosed amount  in . Liljenquist  who promptly donated the photo to the Library of Congress  told BuzzFeed News that the sale contract prohibited him from disclosing the price he paid.  Silas ’s descendants are relieved that the picture ended up in the Library of Congress. But for some of them  the sale of the photograph means that the family that once owned  Silas  was able to exploit  him  one final time. “It’s just continuing to make money off of a dead slave  that’s the way I see it  them selling the tintype ” said Myra. “So that’s pretty low. That’s about as low as you can go.“","['“That’s the white graveyard ” Cyril Chandler    said  gesturing with a scarred hand injured in a printing press accident decades ago. “This is the black one on the other side.” Cyril then guided me to the small stone obelisk marking the grave of his great-grandfather  Silas Chandler  a former slave who went to war alongside his Confederate master and a man who in death has become a source of controversy he could never have imagined.

Chandler's family recalls the two men as not having a typical master and slave relationship. “Andrew Martin and  Silas  kind of grew up together and were crawling around on the kitchen floor as children ” Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. said. “And they hunted and fished and grew up as young boys together.” According to his pension application   Silas  was born in   seven years before Andrew  and was one of  slaves owned by the Chandlers. Mississippi seceded in January   declaring  “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery ” and decrying the Northern states’ supposed designs on “negro equality.” At the time  almost half of Mississippi’s white population owned slaves  and slaves made up a majority of the state’s population. The iconic photo was taken some time after Andrew took  Silas  to war later that year. Both families recall  Silas  being the line of communication between battlefield and family  transporting messages and supplies back and forth. Andrew's regiment fought through some of the toughest battles of the Western Theater of the Civil War  and Andrew was captured at the Battle of Shiloh in April . According to a letter Levin provided to BuzzFeed News  Andrew wrote to his mother  Louisa  in August  worried that  Silas  could end up in Union hands. “If the Feds were to capture him  they might take him along with them ” Andrew wrote. Andrew’s concern about  Silas ’s capture could be interpreted as concern for a dear friend. But it could have just as easily been fear of losing his property. That month  President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Second Confiscation Act  freeing all slaves owned by Confederate soldiers. If the “Feds” had “captured” Silas  he’d be a free man. In September    Andrew Chandler  and  his  regiment  the  Mississippi Infantry  were part of the Confederate forces under Gen. Braxton Bragg that routed Maj. General William Rosecrans’s Union forces at the Battle of Chickamauga. The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war  with   casualties on the Union side and more than   on the Confederate side. The  suffered greatly  with nearly % of the -soldier regiment killed or injured. Andrew was shot in the leg during the battle. Family legend has it that the Confederate surgeon recommended amputation  and  Silas   using a gold coin sewn into his jacket for emergencies  bought a crate of whiskey to bribe the surgeon to let him take Andrew away. He managed to smuggle Andrew onto a boxcar to Atlanta. Genealogy notes passed down by Andrew’s family contain the recollections of Mary Ivy  Chandler   Andrew’s daughter. Mary Ivy says in the notes that Andrew’s uncle   Kyle Chandler   was waiting in Atlanta with a carriage and a nurse to bring Andrew and  Silas  back."", 'A Confederate medical document from  uncovered by PBS confirms the story of Andrew’s injury  showing a gunshot wound to his right leg and ankle at Chickamauga  but nothing beyond family lore supports the gold coin story — neither Mary Ivy’s account nor his obituary in Confederate Veteran magazine mentions it. ""I never heard that story  until  Silas  came to the forefront on the internet  after the story that was built up to put that iron cross on  his  grave ” said Myra. ""I never heard that from my grandfather; I never heard that from my father. I never believed that they would have given a slave money."" In fact  the genealogy notes raise the possibility that it may have been Kyle  not Silas  who got the whiskey  and for the hometown doctor rather than the army surgeon. “Uncle Kyle paid the doctor $ a day for his services in caring for Papa  and that was what one quart of whiskey cost him ” Mary Ivy says in the notes. “I often wonder if the whiskey was for patients or if the doctor drank it.” Regardless  Andrew’s leg was saved  although it would never again work properly.  Silas  was sent back off to war as a servant for Andrew’s younger brother  Benjamin Chandler  in the  Mississippi Cavalry. Battaile Sr. believes  Silas  served the Chandler family out of loyalty. “I don\'t think it was something that  he  seriously objected to  because  he  had freedom to go back and forth and travel at will ”  he  said. “If  he  had been totally against it   he  could have run away at any time  I\'m sure.”  Silas \'s family members recall that relationship  and the iconic photograph of the two men  very differently. “The Confederates always  that  he  could’ve run away any time   he  always returned ” said Myra. “ He  always returned because  he  had a wife and  his  first son  William Henry  was born while  he  was off at war ... That’s why  he  never ran away.”', 'Nelson W. Winbush  a black member of the SCV from Tennessee  told anyone who would listen that his grandfather  “private” Louis Napoleon Nelson  was a Confederate soldier fighting under Nathan Bedford Forrest  the first national leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Nelson’s pension records actually list him as a “cook” and “servant.” An example of a black Confederate soldier that Allen provided to BuzzFeed News was Holt Collier  a Mississippi man whose biography from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identifies him as having “joined the Confederacy” to become a “sharpshooter” and “military spy.” Collier’s pension records identify him as a slave. None of these stories  however  have anything like the arresting tintype of Andrew and Silas Chandler  an image that seems to embody fantasies of the post-racial Confederacy  which explains why to this day those testifying to the existence of black Confederates invoke their image. As recently as January the Richmond Times-Dispatch published a syndicated column invoking the myth of black Confederates featuring the photograph of  Silas  and Andrew. Myra Chandler said that her father  Silas’s grandson  went to his grave angry that  Silas ’s image had been used to perpetuate a myth. “ He  knew that  Silas  was not a soldier —  he  was a slave ” Myra said. “And  he  knew that  he  was being used to promote something that was false.”', 'Confederate heritage organizations were first alerted to the story of Andrew and  Silas  in the early  when Bobbie Chandler   Silas ’s great-grandson  gave a copy of the famous photo to the Washington Times for a story. Bobbie worked there as a production manager.', ""“We had employees donating different things and I donated the story of  Silas  ” Bobbie said. “That’s what started everything.” The Washington Times story led to the reunion between the descendants of the two men  and drew the attention of the UDC and SCV  which culminated in the  ceremony at  Silas ’s grave. The original tintype might have remained hidden  but for Andrew Chandler Battaile Jr.’s decision to have it appraised on a  episode of Antiques Roadshow on PBS. “They're about the same age  joined the Confederate Army when Andrew was    Silas  was   and they fought in four battles together ” Chandler Battaile Jr. told the appraiser  Wes Cowan  on Antiques Roadshow. Cowan estimated the value of the photograph at $  to $ . “It's very interesting to learn more about it  and I'm honored to be able to steward this on behalf of my family and Bobbie's family ” Andrew Battaile Jr. told Cowan  who emphasized the rarity of seeing a contemporary image from the Civil War of a black man in Confederate uniform. “It’s the only one of its kind ” said Tom Liljenquist  a prominent Civil War photo collector whose name is featured on a collection at the Library of Congress. “How many pictures have you seen of a Confederate soldier with his slave? There aren’t any.” The Antiques Roadshow episode spurred an episode of History Detectives  with Cowan seeking to determine the nature of the relationship between Andrew Chandler and Silas Chandler."", '“According to their family story  the Chandlers granted  Silas   his  freedom just before the war and that  he  fought heroically alongside  his  former master in the  Mississippi Regiment ” Cowan noted on History Detectives. (Battaile Jr. told BuzzFeed News that  he  first heard  Silas  might have been a soldier from Bobbie Chandler. Bobbie says  he  first heard  Silas  might have been a soldier from a write-up in the neo-Confederate publication Southern Partisan.) It’s unclear where this piece of family lore that  Silas  was freed crept in — the  newspaper article about their relationship during the war describes  Silas  as Andrew’s slave. Cowan proved that  Silas  was a slave through  his  pension records  that  he  had not been set free or bought  his  freedom prior to the war and that the Chandler family had not donated the land upon which  Silas  founded a church for former slaves after the war. The weapons in the famous photograph were props likely given to them just for the picture. “I think it’s interesting to understand the place of stories in family histories. Obviously  the story that we’ve shared is one that is very comfortable  and comforting to believe ” Battaile Jr. told Cowan. “But without documentary evidence  it is a story. Our families’ histories have been  and will always be  deeply intertwined and evolving with the times.” The episode seemed to show the Chandler families united  as they appeared to be the warm  rainy day that the SCV and UDC laid honors at  Silas ’s grave in . Bobbie and Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. were both there  representing Andrew and  Silas   seemingly reconciled. Myra Chandler Sampson  in the meantime  was frustrated because the episode confirmed what she had discovered through her research:  Silas  was no Confederate soldier.', 'The discoveries on History Detectives upended stories that both families had told for years. Andrew Chandler’s family believed  Silas  had been freed and had therefore joined the Confederate cause willingly  and  Silas ’s family believed that  Silas   a talented carpenter  had bought his freedom through money he earned by doing odd jobs on the side in West Point  Mississippi. Neither story could possibly be true — Mississippi outlawed manumission of slaves  and after emancipation there would have been no need for manumission.  Silas ’s family had always believed  he  had bought  his  own freedom. The realization that  he  couldn’t have made  Silas ’s grandson believe that  Silas  had been “tricked” into buying a freedom that had already been purchased in blood. “My father believes that  Silas  was already freed when he bought his freedom ” said Myra Chandler Sampson of her father   Silas’s  grandson. “And they took his money  and let him think that he bought his freedom.”', 'Today West Point is still a mostly black town of about    dotted with aging memorials to the Confederate States of America. Cyril Chandler moved back in the  to live in the home built by  Silas ’s son in the same place where  Silas  once built his own dwelling  across the street from the church  Silas  founded.  Silas ’s name is carved into the cornerstone.  Silas  and  his  wife  Lucy  had  children  and  he  taught  his  sons to shoot and to build  lessons that were passed down through the generations.  He  taught them to rely on  and defend  themselves.', ""“My granddaddy   he  always bragged on the fact that  he  could shoot a squirrel's eye out as  he 's climbin' up a tree ”  Silas 's great-granddaughter Sara Wims said with a laugh. “People around the town  a lot of times there were some whites that were not so nice — they knew that  he  would shoot those guns at any time.”"", 'Battaile Sr. said  Silas  remained close to the family after the war. “My mother knew  him  very well ”  he  said. "" He  used to take her fishing and picnicking and things like that.  He  stayed close to the family after the war and after emancipation.” Nevertheless  the families connected rarely as time went on. The Chandler Battailes moved elsewhere  while the descendants of Kyle Chandler  Andrew’s uncle  remained in West Point. Sara Wims recalled a Chandler family reunion near or in West Point in which  Silas ’s son  her grandfather  George Chandler  was invited. (Neither Kyle Chandler III nor Andrew Chandler Battaile Sr. recalled the family reunion.) “I was about   and they invited my grandfather to come to tell them about  Silas  ” said Sara. ""But they wanted  him  to bring me along  since I was   so that I could babysit the kids that were there. At that time  my grandfather wouldn\'t hear of it.” George  she said  refused to sit at a table with Andrew Chandler’s family  despite being invited to do so. “Maybe  he  had been so conditioned that  he  didn\'t feel as if  he  should be a part of the family as much as sitting with them to eat.” The interactions between the families were not all fraught. Bobbie Chandler recalled that  when their home burned down when he was a child  the descendants of Kyle Chandler living in West Point helped out financially  donating money to build a new house. (Kyle Chandler III said he did not remember if his family had helped out Bobbie’s.)', 'Silas Chandler’s grandchildren grew up in a segregated West Point full of paradoxes.  Silas ’s labors had left them better off than many of their white neighbors  who were friendly when no one was around but denigrated them when other whites were present. They went to a private all-black Presbyterian school instead of the local segregated one. “After school we used to get out there with the white kids and play ball ” said Bobbie. “A couple times they had people come by and say  \'The white kids and the black kids are not supposed to play ball together.’” Myra’s recollection is a bit harsher. “They were only friends with us when they were around us — for sure we played with them. I even took a bath with the little girl  she was my friend ” Myra said. “But outside of our neighborhood  we were niggers. So that’s the way that was.” Most of the black Chandlers moved away from West Point  except for Cyril  who moved back in  after college and started his own printing business. After going to Howard University  Sara moved to Detroit to raise her children. Myra was a schoolteacher in California until she retired years ago. Bobbie and his brother Jimmy ran a printing business together for  years in Washington  D.C. (A sixth sibling  George  moved to Chicago  where he worked in a metal refinery. He died last year.) Though they mostly lost touch with Andrew Chandler’s family before the ceremony in   state documents show at least one of his descendants  Kyle Chandler II — from the same family that Bobbie said helped out when Bobbie’s home burned down — was a member of the White Citizens’ Councils in West Point in the late   an organization dedicated to preserving white supremacy. Kyle is named as a member of the council in a document that identifies George Chandler   Silas ’s son  as one of the members of the black community who might be “members of the NAACP and potential troublemakers in the event of a racial crisis.” (Battaile Sr. described Kyle as a “distant cousin ” Kyle Chandler III seemed surprised and dismayed by the information about his father  Kyle Chandler II.) Bobbie said that he has a “good relationship” with the Chandler Battailes  and that they used to go out to dinner together when he visited Mississippi  but haven’t spoken in years. Once it became clear that  Silas  was a slave  not a soldier  Bobbie and Cyril decided they agreed with the rest of the family and didn’t want the Confederate honors at  Silas ’s grave. “I’m glad that the Confederate flag was moved off of  his  grave  and I’m glad that the Confederate flag has been removed from the state capitol and things like that  in some states ” said Bobbie. “I made a mistake.” The cross was stolen  and though Confederate flags continued to be placed at  Silas ’s resting place  those would disappear too. Sometimes Cyril would take them  sometimes someone else. As for the tintype  Bobbie told BuzzFeed News that Andrew Chandler’s family had agreed to split the money with them if it was sold. ""I never did receive any of that ” he said. Andrew Chandler Battaile Jr. — who today works for the foundation that preserves Stratford Hall  the ancestral home of the family of Robert E. Lee — says there was no such agreement  despite the fact that the value of the photograph is due to  Silas ’s presence in it. “I never heard of such an agreement  no ” Battaile Jr. said. The tintype was sold to Liljenquist  the collector  for an undisclosed amount  in . Liljenquist  who promptly donated the photo to the Library of Congress  told BuzzFeed News that the sale contract prohibited him from disclosing the price he paid.  Silas ’s descendants are relieved that the picture ended up in the Library of Congress. But for some of them  the sale of the photograph means that the family that once owned  Silas  was able to exploit  him  one final time. “It’s just continuing to make money off of a dead slave  that’s the way I see it  them selling the tintype ” said Myra. “So that’s pretty low. That’s about as low as you can go.“']","['“That’s the white graveyard ” Cyril Chandler    said  gesturing with a scarred hand injured in a printing press accident decades ago', '“This is the black one

4094,test,"But halfway through his film  what began as an experiment on himself turns into something much bigger. One of the film's main subjects blows the whistle on a massive Russian doping program with links to the highest levels of Russian government. And the film pivots to the tale of Grigory Rodchenkov  the mastermind behind that program  and the man who happened to be guiding Fogel through his own program  and the man now fearing for his life.
On Fogel's first impressions of Grigory Rodchenkov
Well   Grigory  at the time oversaw the testing of all Russian athletes across all sports  and all international competitions in Russia — of all athletes coming to Russia to compete — on top of the Sochi games. And this guy is just this incredibly likable  enigmatic  larger-than-life personality.
Well  I mean  it was beyond strange . And it was jaw-dropping. And it was also why  at that time before  you know  it pivoted  I felt like I still had a really interesting film. The fact that I've got this Russian scientist  who was supposed to be catching athletes for doping  breaking every single rule in the book to not only help me dope but to tell me what to do  and then even go so far as to come to Los Angeles to collect all of my urine samples which I had been taking  to bring them back to Moscow to test them in his WADA -accredited lab — I mean  everything about what he was doing was against the rules.
It was a combination of oh-my-God  scared  shocked. Russia's suspended from world track and field. And then  Putin is on television — on Russia- — holding an official press conference not only denying all the allegations of this report  but that if any of this proves to be true  that it will be the individuals that are held accountable and that punishment will be absolute. And at that point   Grigory  has two FSB  KGB agents living in  his  apartment  ""guarding  him ."" And five days after the report  I'm on Skype with  Grigory   and  Grigory  is telling me that  he  has got word from other of  his  friends within the KGB  the FSB that they have planned  his  suicide and that  he  needs to escape.
This happened so fast. I mean  this is — six days after this report  Russia for whatever reason didn't have  him  on the do-not-fly list. And  he 's somehow able to get out of the country. I bought the plane ticket — I put it on my credit card.  He  comes with just a backpack in  his  hand and three hard drives. And we put them up in a safe house in Los Angeles.
And over the next month  I discover that not only is  Grigory  involved —  Grigory  is the mastermind of a spectacular  unbelievable scandal that calls into question every medal ever won in the Olympic Games. And not only that   he  oversaw the Sochi Olympics  where Russia won  medals  and they did it through this elaborate Ocean's Eleven-style scheme  where they had literally created holes in the laboratory to slip out the dirty urine samples of all the Russian athletes and swap out their urine with clean urine. And this guy was the only man on planet Earth who had this evidence. And he was able to prove it.
What happened at Sochi he was incredibly upset about  because he had went from being a scientist  meaning his whole life is — yes  it's doing the exact opposite of what he should be doing  but he was using science to beat the system. There was a differentiation that he made in his mind. But at Sochi  this wasn't about science. This was just fraud. This was literally like breaking into a bank vault and substituting real money for counterfeit money. It was spiraling out of control. And after Sochi   he  was promised it would stop. Instead   he 's doing it for the swimming world championships.  He 's doing it for the collegiate athletic world championships. And there's essentially no end in this. And as you also see in the film  as you see that  he 's disposable like so many others that betray the government or whatever.
 He  is in protective custody. And the reason why is the Department of Justice and FBI has been sitting on this case for the last  months. And we're very  very optimistic that our government is going to continue to protect  him  because regardless of the wrongs that  he  did  it was tremendous courage and honesty to come forward with this staggering amount of evidence and let the world know what had happened. And without  him   we would still be in the dark about this.","[""But halfway through his film  what began as an experiment on himself turns into something much bigger.

People are talking a lot about what happened after a dinner date between the comedian Aziz Ansari and a young woman going by the name of Grace. That's not her real name. The website Babe published her account of that date and said it protected her identity because she's not a public figure. Grace says she decided to tell her story after she saw  Aziz Ansari  win an award at last week's Golden Globes.  He  was wearing a pin to support the movement against sexual harassment and assault.
MCEVERS: We should just say  Aziz Ansari  acknowledged in a statement that this date did happen.  He  said  quote  ""we ended up engaging in sexual activity  which by all indications was completely consensual.""  He  went on to say  he  was surprised and concerned when Grace expressed to  him  in a text the next day that what happened was not OK with her. You know  so what do you make of that?
NORTH: I was glad that  he  had apologized. I thought it was very believable that  he  said that by all accounts the activity was consensual.

A lower middle-class community comprised primarily of relatively inexpensive  modest-sized row homes owned overwhelmingly by working class whites  the ‘Burg’s narrow streets—invariably impeccable—bustled with the finest Italian eateries  from five star restaurants to pizza and steak houses; from bakeries to taverns to “social clubs”; from educational institutions to (mostly Catholic) churches to family-friendly parks.
 Among  these parks  is Columbus Park  home to an impressive bronze statue of the man after whom the park is named.
However  while this monument has been the centerpiece of the park for over  years  Jeff informs readers that there are residents of the ‘Burg that are calling for it to be razed on the grounds of its “offensiveness.”
The ‘Burg  you see  has long since ceased to be Little Italy.It is now the city’s largest Hispanic section  home to thousands of immigrants  many of whom are illegal  from Central and South America.
Those of the ‘Burg’s Italian restaurants that survived are now in the suburbs. A few years ago  when the owner of Rossi’s Bar and Grill  a staple of this once-thriving restaurant district  announced that his business would be leaving for nearby Hamilton Township  he replied to concerns expressed by customers that “it is not the building that makes the place  it’s the people that make the place  and we are keeping all of the same people.”
Unlike in the ‘ and ‘  Rossi said  when it was Europeans who were settling the ‘Burg  today “it’s the Central American people who are…coming over here” and “buying houses ” “establishing little food stores ” and “buying two cars.” In other words  “exactly the same thing is happening in Chambersburg as happened in the ‘.”
The Rossi of ’  not unlike some other public commentators on the ‘Burg’s demographic transformation  suggests that Chambersburg remains essentially one and the same place even as the people who made it the distinctive community that it was have been displaced by others with traditions  languages  customs  and mores that are not only different from  but  at times  radically incompatible with  those of the indigenous inhabitants.
The Rossi of  speaks more sensibly when  though speaking of his restaurant  not the ‘Burg generally  he reminds concerned customers that it is not a building  i.e. dead matter  that grounds the identity of a human entity—a business  a home  a neighborhood  a town  a country—but the people who created  nourished  cherished  and perfected it.
Chambersburg may have the same name  but it is fundamentally not the same neighborhood.That the former inhabitants of  the ‘Burg  held a vision of Christopher Columbus that is not only different from  but antithetical to  that held by its current residents exposes as self-delusional or deceptive anyone who would suggest that this is the same neighborhood as it has always been.
 The ‘Burg  provides as well a microscopic vision of America as a whole: Just as Little Italy is not defined by brick and mortar but by the Italians and Americans of Italian descent that constitute it  so too America is what it is by virtue of those who settled and made it. The statue of Columbus was placed in and preserved for over a half-a-century in a park that the ‘ Burg ’s residents named after the explorer as well. Columbus they regarded as an epic hero. Apparently  today’s inhabitants of this same geographical area want that statue gone  for Columbus  by their lights  is an epic villain.
 The ‘Burg  is no longer  the ‘Burg . And can anyone doubt that America will cease to be America if and when it becomes predominantly occupied by untold millions of people from those same lands from which Chambersburg’s current residents hail?","['I was raised in Franklin Park  a neighborhood that’s adjacent to Chambersburg.

Remember how you felt when  she  introduced you to new people and wild ideas that evolved into lifelong friends and brilliant  finished art.
Feel the spark of conversation  and the bright  wicked laughter you shared together  and the buzz of the next story  she  was itching to tell.
Crack one of  her  books and read again. Imagine  her  sitting beside you and reading it aloud. (May I humbly recommend any of the short stories from “The Story Until Now”).

KATE WELLS  BYLINE:  Larry Nassar  sits in the witness stand wearing a blue jail jumpsuit and orange Crocs.  He  looks thin and shrunken after months behind bars. The judge placed  him  so  he  is forced to look at the more than  women and girls who  one after another  say  he  abused them. Many of them are like Jennifer Rood-Bedford  athletes who went to  Dr. Nassar 's sports medicine clinic at Michigan State University. But the treatments  she  received there were not medical.
WELLS:  Nassar  was seen as a miracle worker.  His  walls were plastered with pictures of  his  patients on the Olympic gymnastics team. Rood-Bedford's teammates told her he was a little touchy  but in reality  he was inappropriately touching their genitals without wearing gloves or getting consent. Laying on that table  Rood-Bedford told herself  it must be OK.

AMANDA THOMASHOW: And   Larry   the thing you didn't realize while you were sexually assaulting me and all of these young girls and breaking our lives is that you were also building an army of survivors who would ultimately expose you for what you truly are - a sexual predator.

4104,test,"Russian soccer players were protected from being caught doping under direct government orders that  laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov  said  he  followed to ensure cheating was covered up as part of a far-reaching conspiracy.
Outlining  his  involvement in soccer for the first time to  The Associated Press  Rodchenkov  claimed an instruction to ""avoid any scandal"" came from then-sports minister Vitaly Mutko  who now serves as a deputy prime minister despite being involved in the doping scheme.
""Russian footballers were immune from doping-control actions or sanctions ""  Rodchenkov  said in response to questions through  his  lawyer from  his  hiding place in the United States.
 Rodchenkov  fled Russia two years ago to confess to  his  role in a widespread doping cover-up in  his  homeland  notably at the  Winter Olympics in Sochi and by track and field athletes.
FIFA has only recently strived to obtain evidence relating to soccer from  Rodchenkov   with particular suspicion around  cases identified by the World Anti-Doping Agency which are said to include members of the  World Cup squad.  Rodchenkov  is skeptical about FIFA's determination to uncover the extent performance-enhancing substances were used by Russian players and avoid punishment.
When asked about Infantino's remark   Rodchenkov  replied to the AP: ""This is more burying heads in the sand.""
FIFA said it has now submitted  ""specific questions"" to  Rodchenkov  through a lawyer designated by WADA.
In correspondence with  the AP  Rodchenkov  provided  his  first account of how  he  helped footballers escape doping sanctions at the behest of the government.
""Mutko ordered protection for Russian footballers when  he  was the president of the Russian Football Union "" Rodchenkov said. "" He  told me directly to 'avoid any scandal by hiding positive results' and 'doping would be handled internally ' meaning that those doping irresponsibly or without protocols could be disciplined or reported.""
While not stating that  he  helped footballers to obtain drugs — like in other sports — Rodchenkov admits to being complicit in the cover-up.

4114,test,"With  Jared Kushner  coming under fire for having to add more than  contacts to  his  security clearance form  Democrats are taking aim at another top White House adviser — Ivanka Trump.
Democrats are inquiring about whether Trump  the White House assistant who is President Donald Trump's daughter and Kushner's husband  similarly failed to disclose contacts that  Kushner  had on her own clearance form.
The group of  House Democrats pointed to contacts  Kushner  failed to report initially  such as  his  meetings with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak  Russian banker Sergey Gorkov  and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya  the latter of which was also attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the president's eldest son  Donald Trump Jr.  in June .
""The fact that Jared Kushner initially omitted this meeting from his   and only disclosed it after coming under considerable scrutiny  implies that he knew something untoward had happened "" Beyer  a Virginia Democrat  said in a statement  adding that ""Kushner should not be permitted access to classified material  he should not be empowered to conduct official business on behalf of the American people  and he should not be allowed to continue in any capacity as a counselor to the president.""
""He has irrevocably betrayed the public trust "" he continued. ""Jared Kushner must resign. If he will not  he should be fired.""
Democrats made an effort to have Kushner's clearance stripped last week  when Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida  introduced a pair of amendments to  appropriations bills aimed at revoking  Kushner 's clearance. The amendments were both voted down by  to  margins.
Republicans too have expressed concern regarding the clearances after news of  Kushner 's attendance at the meeting with Veselnitskaya. Emails released by Trump Jr. showed the meeting was set up on the premise of the Russian lawyer providing the Trump campaign with supposedly damaging information on Hillary Clinton.
Trump Jr.'s ""preemptive release of the emails that led to the meeting with the Russian operative puts Jared Kushner in legal peril "" Rick Tyler  the communications director for Republican Sen.

4115,test,"The defense evaluation quotes  Christian  as saying the two girls were  feet away and  he  didn't speak to them or direct  his  comments at them.
""At odds with accounts in the media   Mr. Christian  reported that the two girls on the MAX did not cross  his  mind "" wrote Dr. Mark D. Cunningham  a Seattle-based psychologist.
Cunningham said  Christian  liked to make inflammatory comments in public to assert his right to free speech but was not driven by racial hatred. He had consumed sangria that day and planned to ""do his free speech thing"" because he was angry about being pepper-sprayed the night before by a passenger on another train.
"" Mr. Christian  reported that if  he  has been drinking   he  tends to 'talk politics' on the MAX to see if  he  'can get someone's goat '"" Cunningham wrote.
According to the detective's previous testimony  Christian got on the train about  minutes before the attack  initially talking on  his  cellphone before making statements toward passengers in an agitated manner. Michaels said many witnesses heard xenophobic comments and rants about free speech.
Fletcher recalled  Christian  yelling at the girls — one of whom was wearing hijab — and saying they didn't belong in the United States. Fletcher moved toward  Christian  as the girls moved away  Michaels said. He joined another man  Shawn Forde  in trying to get Christian to be quiet.
Forde then told Fletcher to let it go  and the college student stopped talking to  Christian  for about three minutes  the detective said.
During that period  Namkai-Meche moved away from  Christian  as he spoke to his aunt on the phone. She suggested he record the rant in case something happened.
Under cross-examination  Michaels acknowledged that a witness heard Namkai-Meche tell  Christian : ""You're going to be an Internet sensation.""
 Christian  grabbed the cellphone and threw it to the ground. The men stood ""chest to chest "" the detective said  and  Christian  repeatedly challenged Namkai-Meche to ""Do something!""
Fletcher defended his fellow passenger  and  Christian  shoved both men. Fletcher pulled Christian backward  then gave him another shove toward the open door of the now-stopped train  Michaels said.
 Christian  pulled out a knife and gave Fletcher a roundhouse stab in the neck  the detective testified. He then stabbed Namkai-Meche and Best  who had tried to stop the attack  Michaels said.
Cunningham  the defense psychologist  said  Christian  spent more than eight years in prison during his early adulthood and may have had a ""fight or flight"" reaction when the passengers confronted him.  Christian  fought frequently in prison and spent much of his incarceration in solitary confinement  where he was suicidal  he wrote.
Friends interviewed for the evaluation said  Christian 's psychological health seemed to deteriorate in the six months before the attack and a family meeting shortly before may have further destabilized him  Cunningham said.
His mother told him he would need to move his collection of   comic books out of her house. She said she would pay for two months of storage and then  Christian  would be on  his  own  the psychologist wrote.  Christian  had never lived alone.
 He  had dropped out of high school  worked four years at a pizza shop before prison  has never had a romantic relationship and doesn't know how to drive  the report said.  He  doesn't know how to engage in conversation and often makes provocative statements to compensate for  his  social dysfunction  Cunningham wrote.","[""The defense evaluation quotes  Christian  as saying the two girls were  feet away and  he  didn't speak to them or direct  his  comments at them."", '""At odds with accounts in the media   Mr. Christian  reported that the two girls on the MAX did not cross  his  mind "" wrote Dr. Mark D.

4119,test,"Washington Post reporters Chelsea Janes and Robert Samuels break down 'who to watch' as the U.S. men's figure skating team heads to South Korea for the  Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. ( Jon Gerberg/The Washington Post)
Nathan Chen  the -year-old figure-skating phenom out of Utah   deserves every bit of the hype that surrounds  his  gold medal chances at the  Winter Games because  he  will attempt one of the most challenging routines ever performed at the Olympics.
At  years old   he  became the youngest winner of the U.S. novice championship. Two years later   Chen  broke the all-time scoring record at the U.S. junior championships. At the  national championships   he  made history again  becoming the first man in international skating history to land five quadruple jumps in one  /-minute program.  He  also executed two quads in  his  short program. Then  Chen  did it again to win the  nationals as well as qualify for the Olympics. In PyeongChang   he  has  his  sights set on becoming the first — and currently the only — figure skater competing with five different types of quadruple jumps: the loop  toe loop  Salchow  flip and Lutz.
Add both scores together and you get a skater’s composite score  with the highest total composite score from all judges determining the winner. It’s here where  Chen ’s degree of difficulty gets rewarded.
During the  U.S. championships   Chen ’s average base value of  his  free-skating program was .  with a high of . after the execution of the quad Lutz with a triple toe loop. The second-place finisher  Ross Miner  had an average base value of .  with a high of . after successfully completing a triple Lutz/single loop/triple Salchow combination. With  elements in each free-skate program   Chen ’s added degree of difficulty effectively gives  him  a .-point advantage  assuming each skater flawlessly executes  his  routine. That’s roughly the base value of a quad Lutz  the second-highest-rated maneuver in the sport. So  should  Chen  land all  his  jumps   he  basically gets another high-value jump added to  his  score  a huge advantage over the competition that not only raises  his  potential for a high score but also serves as a buffer for any missteps.
 U.S. championships  free-skate program Average base value Highest base value Final score  Nathan Chen    . . . Ross Miner   . . .
As if the degree of planned difficulty wasn’t high enough in  his  nationals performance   Chen  was supposed to execute a triple axel (base value of .) and instead went with a perfectly executed quad Salchow (base value .)  pushing  his  point total even higher.
The short program of the  U.S. championships was more of the same.  Chen  planned two elements that carried double-digit base values — a quad flip/triple toe loop combination and a quad Lutz — whereas Adam Rippon  the second-place finisher in the short program  had none. Here we can see where the added difficulty gives  Chen  some breathing room if  he  feels  he  can’t execute some of the harder jumps —  he  ditched the quad lutz and executed a quad toe loop instead  a slightly easier maneuver earning  him  a composite score of . for that particular move.

If  Chen  would have executed  his  maneuvers as well as Hanyu  it would have given  Chen  an edge of at least eight points in the free-skating portion of the event  enough to bridge the gap between  him  and the comparative veteran  . And that’s the true benefit of creating such a difficult program: It puts the -year-old in position to topple some of the best figure skaters on the planet. This could be particularly true because Hanyu must cope with ligament damage to his right ankle sustained in November as he seeks to become the first figure skater in  years to win consecutive Olympic gold medals.

4122,test,"As  Ryu  explained it in an op-ed recently written for the New York Times  people in his position don’t need a tax break.  Ryu ’s concern  among other things  is that “four out of every five dollars in proposed tax cuts will flow to the top  percent  an egregious wealth transfer to those who least need it.”
Oh well  in fairness to the  percent “who least need it ”  Ryu  might acknowledge in a quiet moment that  he  overstated  his  case a tad. Implicit in the notion of “wealth transfer” is that there’s a fixed pie of wealth before and after innovation takes place  and that Republicans merely want to shift the wealth to people like  Ryu . On its own that’s odd when we consider the disdain among the superrich in Silicon Valley for the Republicans  and their strong dislike for the President (Donald Trump) calling for tax cuts  but it’s also worth pointing out that  Ryu ’s reasoning is off.
Indeed  as  he  acknowledges through the rise of Guidewire  with wealth creation there’s no “wealth transfer” to speak of. In  Ryu ’s case  Guidewire achieved stupendous success (  well-paid employees  $ million in sales in over thirty countries) only after “great difficulty "" and yes  ""good fortune.""  Ryu   along with  his  partners  employees and the investors who made Guidewire possible didn’t have wealth transferred to them as much as their hard work created new wealth. What the talented entrepreneur in  Ryu  chooses to do with what’s his  is ultimately his choice.
Still   Ryu  made an interesting point  and it’s one that Republicans focused on the incentive effects of tax cuts would be wise to consider  if only to improve their argument in favor of reducing the tax burden. As  Ryu  put it  “I have never heard someone say  ‘I would have started a company  but tax rates were too high’ or ‘I wouldn’t have started this company  but then George W. Bush cut tax rates  so I did.’”
No doubt  Ryu  is speaking the truth: entrepreneurs have a vision  and it’s arguably true that their own efforts will not be suffocated by rates of taxation. Republicans often talk about reducing the penalty on the “next dollar earned” as a crucial driver of entrepreneurialism  but does anyone seriously think the late Steve Jobs (the top tax rate was  percent when Jobs co-founded Apple)  Michael Dell  or Jeff Bezos contemplated rates of taxation when they began pursuing their entrepreneurial visions?
So while  Ryu  is perhaps right that nosebleed tax rates aren’t the barrier to individual entrepreneurial endeavor in the way that Republicans assume   his  argument nonetheless makes the Republicans’ case for them.  Ryu  has done the Republicans a favor  because as evidenced by their slow cave-in on actual tax cuts ( Ryu  can rest assured – sadly – that the final GOP tax bill won’t mean much to rich innovators like  him )  the Republicans haven’t a clue about how to turn their rhetoric about tax cuts into growth-enhancing policy. Perhaps it's because they don't understand their own rhetoric  but that's a digression.
Back to  Ryu    he  once again dismisses the notion that income tax rates deter entrepreneurialism  but by  his  own admission  capital gains taxes do. As  he  explains it  “While I can imagine tax regimes that would create disincentives for entrepreneurship  we don’t have that situation today in America  where tax rates on capital gains (the primary way that founders of successful start-ups make money) are already far lower than rates on ordinary income.” Fair enough  but then this is where Ryu most explicitly makes the Republicans’ case for them; one that they’ve never been able to make.","['As  Ryu  explained it in an op-ed recently written for the New York Times  people in his position don’t need a tax break.

Implicit in the notion of “wealth transfer” is that there’s a fixed pie of wealth before and after innovation takes place  and that Republicans merely want to shift the wealth to people like  Ryu . On its own that’s odd when we consider the disdain among the superrich in Silicon Valley for the Republicans  and their strong dislike for the President (Donald Trump) calling for tax cuts  but it’s also worth pointing out that  Ryu ’s reasoning is off.', 'Indeed  as  he  acknowledges through the rise of Guidewire  with wealth creation there’s no “wealth transfer” to speak of. In  Ryu ’s case  Guidewire achieved stupendous success (  well-paid employees  $ million in sales in over thirty countries) only after “great difficulty "" and yes  ""good fortune.""  Ryu   along with  his  partners  employees and the investors who made Guidewire possible didn’t have wealth transferred to them as much as their hard work created new wealth. What the talented entrepreneur in  Ryu  chooses to do with what’s his  is ultimately his choice.', 'Still   Ryu  made an interesting point  and it’s one that Republicans focused on the incentive effects of tax cuts would be wise to consider  if only to improve their argument in favor of reducing the tax burden. As  Ryu  put it  “I have never heard someone say  ‘I would have started a company  but tax rates were too high’ or ‘I wouldn’t have started this company  but then George W. Bush cut tax rates  so I did.’”', 'No doubt  Ryu  is speaking the truth: entrepreneurs have a vision  and it’s arguably true that their own efforts will not be suffocated by rates of taxation. Republicans often talk about reducing the penalty on the “next dollar earned” as a crucial driver of entrepreneurialism  but does anyone seriously think the late Steve Jobs (the top tax rate was  percent when Jobs co-founded Apple)  Michael Dell  or Jeff Bezos contemplated rates of taxation when they began pursuing their entrepreneurial visions?', ""So while  Ryu  is perhaps right that nosebleed tax rates aren’t the barrier to individual entrepreneurial endeavor in the way that Republicans assume   his  argument nonetheless makes the Republicans’ case for them.  Ryu  has done the Republicans a favor  because as evidenced by their slow cave-in on actual tax cuts ( Ryu  can rest assured – sadly – that the final GOP tax bill won’t mean much to rich innovators like  him )  the Republicans haven’t a clue about how to turn their rhetoric about tax cuts into growth-enhancing policy. Perhaps it's because they don't understand their own rhetoric  but that's a digression."", 'Back to  Ryu    he  once again dismisses the notion that income tax rates deter entrepreneurialism  but by  his  own admission  capital gains taxes do. As  he  explains it  “While I can imagine tax regimes that would create disincentives for entrepreneurship  we don’t have that situation today in America  where tax rates on capital gains (the primary way that founders of successful start-ups make money) are already far lower than rates on ordinary income.” Fair enough  but then this is where Ryu most explicitly makes the Republicans’ case for them; one that they’ve never been able to make.']","['As  Ryu  explained it in an op-ed recently written for the New York Times  people in his position don’t need a tax break', 'Ryu ’s concern  among other things  is that “four out of every five dollars in proposed tax cuts will flow to the top  percent  an egregious wealth transfer to those who least need it', 'Oh well  in fairness to the  percent “who least need it ”  Ryu  might acknowledge in a quiet moment that  he  overstated  his  case a tad', 'Implicit in the notion of “wealth transfer” is that there’s a fixed pie of wealth before and after innovation takes place  and that Republicans merely want to shift the wealth to people like  Ryu', 'On its own that’s odd when we consider the disdain among the superrich in Silicon Valley for the Republicans  and their strong dislike for the President (Donald Trump) calling for tax cuts  but it’s also worth pointing out that  Ryu ’s reasoning is off', 'Indeed  as  he  acknowledges through the rise of Guidewire  with wealth creation there’s no “wealth transfer” to speak of', 'In  Ryu ’s case  Guidewire achieved stupendous success (  well-paid employees  $ million in sales in over thirty countries) only after “great difficulty "" and yes  ""good fortune', '""  Ryu   along with  his  partners  employees and the investors who made Guidewire possible didn’t have wealth transferred to them as much as their hard work created new wealth', 'What the talented entrepreneur in  Ryu  chooses to do with what’s his  is ultimately his choice', 'Still   Ryu  made an interesting point  and it’s one that Republicans focused on the incentive effects of tax cuts would be wise to consider  if only to improve their argument in favor of reducing the tax burden', 'As  Ryu  put it  “I have never heard someone say  ‘I would have started a company  but tax rates were too high’ or ‘I wouldn’t have started this company  but then George W', 'Bush cut tax rates  so I did', 'No doubt  Ryu  is speaking the truth: entrepreneurs have a vision  and it’s arguably true that their own efforts will not be suffocated by rates of taxation', 'Republicans often talk about reducing the penalty on the “next dollar earned” as a crucial driver of entrepreneurialism  but does anyone seriously think the late Steve Jobs (the top tax rate was  percent when Jobs co-founded Apple)  Michael Dell  or Jeff Bezos contemplated rates of taxation when they began pursuing their entrepreneurial visions?', 'So while  Ryu  is perhaps right that nosebleed tax rates aren’t the barrier to individual entrepreneurial endeavor in the way that Republicans assume   his  argument nonetheless makes the Republicans’ case for them', 'Ryu  has done the Republicans a favor  because as evidenced by their slow cave-in on actual tax cuts ( Ryu  can rest assured – sadly – that the final GOP tax bill won’t mean much to rich innovators like  him )  the Republicans haven’t a clue about how to turn their rhetoric about tax cuts into growth-enhancing policy', ""Perhaps it's because they don't understand their own rhetoric  but that's a digression"", 'Back to  Ryu    he  once again dismisses the notion that income tax rates deter entrepreneurialism  but by  his  own admission  capital gains taxes do', 'As  he  explains it  “While I can imagine tax regimes that would create disincentives for entrepreneurship  we don’t have that situation today in America  where tax rates on capital gains (the primary way that founders of successful start-ups make money) are already far lower than rates on ordinary income', '” Fair enough  but then this is where Ryu most explicitly makes the Republicans’ case for them; one that they’ve never been able to make']",Self Marcus Ryu,-1,-1,-1,2,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

4134,test,"(WASHINGTON)  — An Alabama state official is citing the Bible to defend the Republican U.S. Senate candidate accused of sexual advances on girls. State auditor Jim Ziegler says “ Mary  was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter ” suggesting that  Roy Moore  acted in a divine tradition if  he  in fact made sexual advances toward a -year-old girl.
Theologians and pastors  among others  expressed revulsion that  Mary  and Joseph would be used to counter allegations of sexual misbehavior with a minor. They also said  Ziegler  got the facts wrong and ignored the cultural context of the time in which Jesus lived.
Moore  a -year-old former state Supreme Court justice  flatly denied allegations of decades-old sexual advances on girls  published Thursday in a Washington Post story. The accounts by multiple women prompted Republican lawmakers to say he should end his candidacy for the Dec.  special election if the allegations are true. “I have never engaged in sexual misconduct ”  Moore  said Friday.
But Ziegler was dismissive about the fuss. “There’s just nothing immoral or illegal here ”  he  told the Washington Examiner. “Maybe just a little bit unusual.”
Rev. Jim Martin  editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America  tweeted Friday that “comparing the allegations against  Roy Moore  in any way to Joseph and Mary is disgusting.” Martin said: “We have no idea about the exact ages of either the Virgin Mary or St. Joseph at the time of their betrothal or marriage.”
She said the earliest text to mention Mary’s age is “The Infancy Gospel of James ” which she describes as “a clearly legendary text that is trying to expand on the gospel accounts.” That non-authoritative text placed  Mary ’s age at  when  she  conceived and it cited supposed evidence of  her  enduring virginity to demonstrate  she  conceived Jesus without sexual intercourse.
Leigh Corfman told the Post she was  when  Moore  first approached her and took her to  his  home twice  the second time touching her over her bra and panties and having her touch  him  over  his  underwear. The Post quoted three other women who said  he  pursued them when they were  to  and  he  was in  his  early .

4136,test,"Harris County emergency management spokesman Francisco Sanchez  said only one training session was held because that was all the county and the Red Cross—which offered the training—had time to organize. A second training was scheduled for August . It was canceled   Sanchez  said  because of Harvey.
 Sanchez  said the Mass Care Plan came about as a result of ""candid conversations"" with the Red Cross about its sheltering capacity during flooding events after previous missteps in the county. ""There is a tendency ""  he  said  ""for American Red Cross process or flow to become very challenged  quite frankly overwhelmed  in flooding events."" But plans are made to be changed in emergencies   Sanchez  said  and that's what happened after Harvey hit. ""A plan is flexible ""  he  said. ""It's scalable. We can apply it and we can adapt it — and we can throw the rules out the window to serve the residents of Harris County.""
That supervisor  Francisco Sanchez  then told ProPublica the reason they did not exist was because the county had decided to leave the task to the Red Cross. ""The end result of the plan and how it was implemented included extensive dialogue offline where we came to an understanding with the American Red Cross that they had unique expertise in selecting and inspecting pre-identified sites "" he said. ""As hurricane season approached  it made sense to rely on the work of the American Red Cross and their existing inspections so we could be prepared to act more swiftly in the event of a storm that threatened our community.""
Asked about the county's failure to identify shelters in advance   Sanchez  pointed to a space that was used successfully—the NRG Convention Center  which ended up housing   people—but only at the last minute. According to  Sanchez   ""Many of the relationships necessary to make that happen were a direct result of writing the mass shelter plan.""
Asked to identify any ways in which the county adhered to the Mass Shelter Plan   Sanchez  said the county ""worked to secure a cache of cots and other supplies"" to supplement the Red Cross' resources; updated the county's mapping system to reflect the location of existing Red Cross shelters; and ""worked extensively to strengthen partnerships with school districts and nonprofits that might support shelter operations.""
Here  too  some of  Sanchez 's assertions didn't square with the memories of others  in this case the Houston Independent School District.

4137,test,"The Trump presidency is itself a provocation. Trump is a billionaire  a reality TV star  a congenital liar who is seemingly addicted to a social media app which he uses to live-tweet his responses to a morning television show. The public is often bombarded with the phenomenon of his inner thoughts being pushed to mobile devices  not only by Twitter  but by pretty much every news outlet on the planet. And with good reason. He controls an arsenal of nuclear weapons  authorizes covert action  and has vast surveillance capacities at his fingertips.  Trump  also brought with  him  to Washington a team of radical ideologues and outsiders — people like Steve Bannon  Stephen Miller  and Sebastian Gorka.  His  attorney general  Jeff Sessions  has a long history of racism  including — according to his former associates — using the N-word and “joking” about joining the Ku Klux Klan.
 Trump  has given encouragement to white supremacists and neo-Nazis  at times through his public statements and  at others  by what he doesn’t say. And  Trump  is the master of the dog whistle. See  for example   Trump  saying there are good people on both sides in the aftermath of the horrible white supremacist violence in Charlotte. Or how  Trump  and  his  acolytes constantly talk about violence in Chicago as a substitute for the racist perspective they only want thinly veiled.  He  calls black athletes “sons of bitches ” says the mass shooter in Las Vegas was “probably smart” and constantly portrays undocumented immigrants as a collective group of gang members  rapists  and murderers.
There is no doubt that the way Trump talks and tweets  the people  he  has chosen to surround  himself  with  and the policies  he  has announced or implemented are all evidence that this is a dangerous administration. But how dangerous relative to past U.S. presidents? If you talk to many Democrats on Capitol Hill  Trump is the most dangerous president in U.S. history. He has also given rise to a new alliance of discredited  hawkish neocons and MSNBC hosts and analysts. Former directors of the CIA  NSA  and DNI have all clamored to condemn him and assure the public that these heroic spy agencies are protecting the country from the madman inside  Pennsylvania Avenue.
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney implemented a global torture network  began shipping people snatched from across the globe to Guantánamo prison  invaded Iraq and Afghanistan  and conducted mass surveillance operations against Americans. The list of horrible presidents who caused unimaginable death and destruction across the globe is vast. None of this absolves  Trump  one bit. But it is important to keep perspective rooted in fact and history.
There is a particular risk in erasing the line between horrible things Trump does with horrible things the U.S. has done for a long time and acting like it is all  Trump . It’s a complicated conversation  but it is one we should have. It means exploring the roots of white supremacy in the U.S.  the way American wars are constantly put through a laundering process to make them seem noble and brave  the way “real American” has been defined and continues to be defined in our society. For eight years  we had the first black president in U.S. history and now we have a reality TV host who spends a great deal of time tweeting and watching TV. So what is unique to Trump and what is embedded in the politics of empire in the U.S.?
You know the other thing that I would add to what you’re saying though is that there’s an interesting kind of flipside to Obama’s careful  kind of prophylactic imagination around the use of American violence  and that is that it sort of draws the ire of the Right. So   Trump  comes in and basically says  you know: We’re going to take the gloves off because this hasn’t worked and now we’re going to sort of free the commanders in the field to use maximum discretion and we’ve already seen what’s happening with that.
JS: Discretion sounds like almost like they’re being — I mean  I know what the words means  but  he ’s widened the rules of engagement so they can kill more civilians if they feel like it’s necessary.
JS: Right  I mean it’s more often aimed at that the police force needs to more accurately reflect the racial or religious makeup of communities. And I wonder how you push back against or respond when people say  “Look  yes  those extreme things  Professor Singh  that you’re about  they happen  everyone knows that they happen. Are we perfect right now? No  we’re not perfect. But we just had two terms of a black president. We came very close to having a woman as president  she got three million more votes in the popular election than  Donald Trump . Police forces across the country are aggressively recruiting and hiring people of color  people who speak multiple languages. Yes  there still is racism  but look at all of the progress that we’ve made and how can you argue that America remains a racist country when a black man was president for eight years?”
JS: I think of that  I mean they knew they weren’t going to get anywhere with that and it was a huge part of the ascent of  Trump .
NS: A huge part of the ascent of  Trump . Meanwhile  Obama’s deporting people en masse  strengthening the deportation machinery  giving speeches  really  that are completely consistent with the language of criminalizing immigration violations. Why should immigration violations be in the domain of the criminal? I mean  these are basically  for the most part  people who are trying to make a living in the United States  many for almost a generation. Right? This could be talked about in a completely different way. Why do we adopt the right’s language that anyone here without papers is somehow a criminal? Why would that be the case?
And now  Trump   of course  accentuates the kind of occasional horrific criminal violation by someone who is out of status and uses that to recursively characterize entire populations. Right?

4138,test,"Victoria was a -year-old heroin addict living in an abandoned building on Chicago’s West Side in  when she says she fell into a trap set by Benjamin Biancofiori.
She’d been kicked out of her west suburban home by her mother in a desperate show of tough love  Victoria  now   testified Thursday in a federal courtroom. After she was jailed on a drug charge  another inmate told her about Biancofiori — that he would get her off the streets  that he’d give her all the drugs she wanted  that he’d take care of her.
“I would have somewhere to go and be out of the cold  somewhere safe ” Victoria said in a quiet voice at Biancofiori’s trial on sex trafficking charges as she recalled why she took the bait.
When she bonded out of jail  an associate of Biancofiori’s nicknamed “Tiger” was there to meet her. He took her to an apartment in northwest suburban Itasca where Biancofiori lived. It was there that  Victoria ’s nightmare began.
Over the next five months   Victoria  testified  she was forced into sexual servitude by Biancofiori  who posted sex ads offering her services on Craigslist  drove her to appointments seven days a week and kept every cent she earned. He plied her with heroin and controlled every aspect of her life  threatening to kill her and her family if she tried to leave   Victoria  said.
One time he punched her so hard in the face she flew into a wall and wet her pants   Victoria  said. Then he made her clean it up and go back to work  she said. On another night  she was exiting the shower when Biancofiori knocked her to the floor  stomped on her and beat her with a towel rack that fell off the wall.
“I remember I couldn’t breathe because my ribs hurt really bad ""  Victoria  told jurors.
 Victoria ’s riveting testimony came on the sixth day of Biancofiori’s trial on charges  he  used violence and threats to operate a lucrative sex-trafficking business in the suburbs that involved at least five victims dating to .
A -page complaint filed in  portrayed Biancofiori as relishing the punishment  he  handed out to the women  he  trafficked. One victim told authorities he frequently pummeled another woman while dressed up like a boxer with a black hooded shirt over his head and mixed martial arts-type fingerless gloves with hard plastic knuckles  according to the charges.
In her cross-examination Thursday  Gambino repeatedly questioned why  Victoria  didn’t just leave or go to the police if the conditions were so bad.
 Victoria  testified  she  had no identification and no money and felt like  she  was always being watched by Biancofiori or one of his associates   she  said.
“I had nowhere to go and nowhere to hide ”  Victoria  testified.
 She  managed to escape in April  after Biancofiori left  Victoria  in the care of one of his henchmen at a Motel  in Elk Grove Village. When  she  complained that all  her  clothes were dirty and  she  wouldn’t be able to see clients for sex  the associate went to the store to buy laundry detergent and briefly left  her  alone   she  said.
“I ran into the manager’s office and told them to lock the door and call  ”  Victoria  said.
In the seven years since   Victoria  said   she  has turned  her  life around.  She  has kicked  her  heroin habit  earned  her  GED and is working as a convenience store manager.

Now that  he  has retired from full-time racing   he 's got time to experience new adventures. Just last weekend   he  went to brunch —  his  first brunch ever — with  his  wife and friends  then was convinced to get  his  first pedicure .
NBC Sports announced Tuesday it will use  Earnhardt  in its pregame show before the Super Bowl  then send  him  to South Korea for the network's coverage of next month's Olympics.  Earnhardt  retired from driving in November and signed on to be an analyst for NBC Sports  a gig that begins in July.

NBC plans to use  Earnhardt  at the Super Bowl in outdoor events and activities taking place in Minneapolis in the days before the game. At the Olympics   he 'll visit the speed skating venue and accept a recent social media invite from American bobsled team pilot Nick Cunningham to ride in a bobsled.

4145,test,"WASHINGTON (AP) —  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner  has lost  his  access to the nation's deepest secrets.  His  credibility as a negotiator may be next.
 Kushner 's loss of  his  top-secret clearance could be particularly problematic in  his  role overseeing the Trump administration's efforts to produce Mideast peace.
The White House insists that  Kushner 's job will be unaffected by this week's downgrade to  his  security clearance. But the new limits on Donald Trump's son-in-law's access to information may well curtail his work — and raise questions about his longevity in the West Wing.
And late Wednesday  The New York Times reported that two companies made loans worth more than half a billion dollars to Kushner's family real estate firm after executives met with  Kushner  at the White House.
In a phone call with The Associated Press Wednesday night  Kushner Cos. spokeswoman Christine Taylor confirmed the loans but said the implication that  Kushner 's position in the White House had affected the company's long-standing relationships with lenders is ""made up and without substantiation.""
A spokesman for  Kushner 's lawyer  Abbe Lowell  said  Kushner  ""has had no role in the Kushner Companies since joining the government.""
Former U.S. and international officials say that even if  Kushner  stays at the White House   his  job won't be the same.
Still   Kushner  is losing access to the highly secret presidential daily brief  and  his  ability to remain in the room for some of Trump's most consequential domestic and foreign policy decisions.
Lowell  Kushner's attorney  said he had not been informed of any reason for the holdup in  Kushner 's permanent top-secret clearance. The presidential aide has been forced to repeatedly correct omissions in his ""SF- "" the government form used to apply for clearances  as well as in his financial disclosure forms.

Intelligence officials have expressed concern that  his  business dealings were a topic of discussion in conversations  he  was having with foreign officials about issues of interest to the U.S. government  a former intelligence official said.
The official  who spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss  Kushner 's security clearance review  said there was a difference of opinion among intelligence officials about the significance of the conversations.
Some believed  Kushner  knew  his  business dealings would likely come up in the conversations and was too naive or inexperienced to know how to steer clear of the topic in light of  his  position as Trump's adviser  the official said. Others thought  Kushner  knew the topic would likely surface and used the opportunity while talking to the foreign officials to engage in conversations about  his  business interests.
In public  administration officials have hewed to the White House line that  Kushner 's work would be unaffected  citing an unusual statement from chief of staff Kelly last week that  he  had ""full confidence in  his  ability to continue performing  his  duties.""
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told Fox News on Tuesday that  Kushner  would remain focused on Middle East peace. ""I can't see any change on the importance of that or  his  work on that issue "" she said.
But privately  officials say there has been no internal communication about  Kushner 's status  leaving aides to learn of changes in the press and sparking speculation that more substantial changes may be afoot.","[""WASHINGTON (AP) —  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner  has lost  his  access to the nation's deepest secrets.

4150,test,"Pratt  has a ""leave no trace"" ethic when it comes to the solar system  and  she  isn't happy about the idea of red sports cars floating around aimlessly in space.
Despite his enthusiasm  Davis didn't get the six figure job (pay ranges from $  to $  a year). Instead  a more seasoned astrobiologist   Lisa Pratt   stepped into the Planetary Protection Officer role earlier this month.
 Pratt  says  she 's deeply concerned with how to ""safely and ethically"" look for life on Mars  without accidentally killing any extraterrestrial life that might be lurking out there.
The idea of extraterrestrial life is not something that only -year-olds get excited about — scientists like  Pratt  are also intrigued by the idea that life may still live  hidden on Mars.
""I fully expect we will encounter life in our solar system ""  she  said.
There might still be life on Mars  and  Pratt  doesn't want us to kill it 
Pratt's  used to looking for life in really harsh places. A professor emeritus at Indiana University   she  has been studying how microorganisms adapt to extreme hot and cold for more than  decades.
Lisa Pratt Anna Powell Teeter/Indiana University
 She 's wandered into active gold mines in South Africa to discover what happens in super-hot waters flowing deep below the Earth's surface.  She 's also ventured to freezing cold mines in the Canadian Arctic to see how life might survive under the ice and snow. Now   she 's setting  her  sights on Mars  where winter temperatures can dip to below - degrees Fahrenheit.
 Pratt  wants to make sure that while we're discovering more about other planets like Mars  we're not dumping a ton of Earth trash into that space. In   a NASA rover is set to land and collect samples from the red planet. And it'll be  her  job to make sure that the mission doesn't make a big mess on Martian soil.
 She  says any bits of Earthly trash that get deposited could mess up our chances of a human future on Mars.

 Flynn  said  “my guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country.”

ABC also reported that  Flynn  made the decision to cooperate with Mueller only in the past  hours  as he faced mounting legal bills and intense pressure from prosecutors. “He is distraught about the decision  but feels he is doing the right thing for his country ” Ross said.
Ross’ report and the information from the plea hearing raised more questions about what exactly was asked of  Flynn .
“If true  what kinds of things did Trump direct  Flynn  to request from Russians officials during and after the campaign?” former federal attorney Preet Bharara tweeted. “Trump is not known for caution or modest requests.”
Robert Costello  the former deputy chief of the Criminal Division for the U.S. Attorney’s Office of New York’s southern district  said  Flynn ’s guilty plea is “highly significant” for Mueller’s team.

Kevin Canas Quitumbo  was  years old when shrapnel from a land mine ripped through  his  left leg  up  his  torso and all the way to the back of  his  skull. That was five years ago.  His  doctors are still working to repair the damage.
""In January and February I have to go back to the hospital ""  he  says. ""The doctors are going to put additional metal rods into my foot.""
 Canas  stepped on the mine during a protest for indigenous rights in the southwestern region of Cauca in Colombia.  He  was with a group of friends  and they wanted to get to the front of the march. So they ran off the main road to cut ahead.
""After the accident I was in the hospital for four months ""  he  says.
For  Canas   the  blast didn't just affect  him  physically; it killed  his  dream.
""The hardest thing is that I can't go back to playing soccer ""  he  says.

4159,test,"Just talking to  Justin Roiland  feels like getting lost in an internet K-hole.
Yawning   he  tells me  he  hit a creative stride last night at  p.m. and couldn't stop until  a.m. This isn't unusual for  him . Actually  it's much tamer than other fevered nights losing sleep over whatever  he 's working on. Like when  he  coaxed Stanley Parable co-creator William Pugh to stay up until  a.m. the week before GDC  to finish the game-jam version of their singular virtual reality experience  Accounting. Or when  he  stayed up even after Pugh left and  in an edible-fueled frenzy  kept working until  he  finally rustled awake Alex Hirsh – his friend and esteemed creator of Gravity Falls – to insist  he  come over to play it at  a.m. Roiland's obsessive enthusiasm for the things  he  makes must be infectious  though  since both friends gave in.
As he recounts these instances of restless passion in his Burbank office   Roiland  shares the couch with a life-sized pillow of Mr. Poopy Butthole  one of the most beloved recurring characters on Rick and Morty. Aside from becoming a ratings hit with a cult following   Roiland  and co-creator Dan Harmon’s juggernaut sci-fi animated-series-that-shouldn’t also found unprecedented critical success. Harmon  of Community fame and infamy  took  Roiland  under  his  wing over a decade ago — managing to simultaneously exacerbate and hone the young creator’s endless capacity to think up the most bizarre  freakish  yet relatable shit to ever grace television.
A balance of nihilistic dread and uninhibited silliness   Roiland ’s the kind of creator you can unironically call the voice of our internet generation. In addition to being one of the driving forces behind Rick and Morty – the rare network TV show that's authentically literate when it comes to games and internet culture – his resonance online only grows sharper the more he expands beyond the world of animation. That world which Roiland and Harmon built lends itself seamlessly to translation across an entire spectrum of mediums  with collaborations like Adult Swim Games and Owlchemy Labs’ VR game Virtual Rick-ality  the popular iOS game Pocket Mortys  and even the comic book series written by Zac Gorman. Aside from Accounting  he also recently launched his own VR studio Squanch Games (previously Squanchtendo)  now currently in the process of producing its first full-length title. It seems nearly everything Roiland touches  from the Adult Swim series to his new forays into VR  cuts through the noise with an absurdity that holds up the mirror to our current day – certifiably a strange time to be alive  especially on the internet
 Roiland  also found the first platform for  his  work online. Sure  no one got or even liked the batshit cartoons and sketches  he  sent to Channel   a monthly short-film festival launched in  that allowed anyone to submit pilots an audience then up or downvoted.  Roiland’s  shows often got the boot. But festival co-founder Dan Harmon loved them all. And  Roiland  had already been compulsively writing and shooting sketches before  when  his  audience was limited to a group of  friends living in  his  hometown of Manteca  California. ""I really wouldn't be doing what I'm doing without the internet ""  he  says. ""It created a forum for  me  – motivated me by just getting more eyeballs on the shit I was constantly making anyway.""
You get the impression that Roiland today – an achingly earnest dude in jeans and a black t-shirt – isn't so different from the one working in relative obscurity in Manteca. The only difference is  recently   he  had the entire internet holding its breath in frantic anticipation. After a grueling two-year delay  the premier of Rick and Morty's third season finally releases at the end of last month. The cord Rick and Morty has struck online stems in no small part from Roiland's both literal and figurative voice. As the actor behind both the show’s unhinged leads  his trademark stutters and burps provide that unique  conversational tone that stands out among its hyper-polished predecessors like The Simpsons  Futurama  or even Adventure Time. But it’s also Roiland’s comic sensibility that  like the internet itself  finds humor in staring into the abyss – and just rolling with it.
None of Roiland's collaborators  whether in gaming  VR  or TV  question his unorthodox process. Accounting co-creator and head of indie studio Crows Crows Crows William Pugh went as far as to call Roiland's creative sensibilities ""unforgivable."" While he himself is known as a game designer with an unconventional bent  even Pugh found  Roiland 's unorthodox process rubbing off on him. ""He taught me where I really need to give less of a fuck "" Pugh says. ""Working with him is like being nine years old  playing pretend in an abandoned warehouse  then finding a body.""
Unsurprisingly   Roiland  thrives in the game jam environment. The sleepless four-day sprint to the finish line with Accounting left no room for overthinking or second guessing. The frenzy of his process – using a whiteboard to quickly brainstorm ideas  spitting out a script  recording it  improvising  bringing it back for assets  taking everyone's feedback  then excitedly running back to the booth to re-record  re-edit  etc. – was a perfect fit.
It wasn't at all unlike what he and Harmon used to do back in the Channel  days. ""He'd come over at  p.m. and we'd just say  'Let's make a show.' So we'd film and wrap by like  or  in the morning  before Dan would go off and edit."" What  Roiland  loves most about these kinds of creative frameworks is the immediacy of it all – seeing this thing come together in the blink of an eye  despite the mad chaotic dash happening around it.
Yet  somewhere in all that free-falling terror   Roiland  somehow figured out how to shape his nihilistic absurdity into something that feels universal. ""I never wanted any animation I did to be too polished  too perfect "" he says. ""My big thing is outtakes as 'in-takes.' I love imperfections. I love when a voice actor fucks up and barrels through a scene without breaking character anyway. Those are the takes you want to use because they're the most human and natural and surprising.""
Tanya Watson  a veteran game producer with titles like Gears of War under her belt  co-founded Squanch Games alongside Roiland. Their vision was to originate a genre that's completely missing from both games and VR: character and narrative-driven comedy. Understandably  Watson had to throw out a lot of the old production conventions she learned while working on other games. Because  unlike  Roiland 's sensibilities  game design is too often conceived of as a constant march toward more and more polished gameplay concepts. ""My top priority at Squanch was to build a production pipeline that allowed  Justin  to just do  his  thing – do what  he  does best "" she says. As it turns out  translating  Roiland 's unconventional  TV-oriented approach to VR game design was surprisingly effortless. ""In a lot of ways we're  throwing out the old rules of game design because this is a new medium. And it's the time – our opportunity – to write the rulebook for VR.""
So while Squanch's experienced team of game designers bring the necessary expertise  the most important qualities  Roiland  and Watson value is flexibility and a willingness to dive into collaboration and iteration. So whenever  Roiland  jumps up during a demo to declare  he  can re-record to make the dialogue funnier  or  their  lead character animator pitches an idea that's just too perfect to not undergo the added work of rewriting and re-recording to implement it   they  can rest sure in the knowledge that Watson's left room for that. In fact  she says she's prepared for the game to be at least  percent improvised. She even incorporated that immediate feedback loop of a game jam  so that whenever  Roiland  re-records or runs with a piece of feedback  they can implement it and make it playable within single day. That means  Roiland  and the team can actually walk around  interact  and play with the new additions that sprung from their minds just a day ago in full on room-scale VR.
From Watson's perspective  VR only heightens the experience of  Roiland 's comedic approach. ""That absurdity makes you especially uncomfortable when you're actually part of it "" she says. ""VR contributes to the comedy because  whenever the player feels uncomfortable  that moment of release when they get to laugh just feels so good.""
For  Roiland   the VR bug really took over him once he first tried room-scale on the Vive. He'd gotten every version of the Oculus DKs early by just ""pestering the shit"" out of anyone who could give him one. ""And I remember being in a Tuscany Villa the first time I put on the  – and just screaming. Literally screaming  'What the fuck?!' By myself. Screaming.""
""That's what  Justin  brings to the table "" says Watson. ""He has all these crazy ideas that no one else in the world is having.""
What  Roiland  seems to grasp about this tetherless  virtual abyss we all find ourselves floating in right now is that  at the very least  you can have company. ""The addiction is still all about that connectivity. Even when it's just consuming content  it's usually content made by regular folks from every corner of the world.""","['Just talking to  Justin Roiland  feels like getting lost in an internet K-hole.', ""Yawning   he  tells me  he  hit a creative stride last night at  p.m. and couldn't stop until  a.m. This isn't unusual for  him .

conceived of as a constant march toward more and more polished gameplay concepts"", '""My top priority at Squanch was to build a production pipeline that allowed  Justin  to just do  his  thing – do

demo to declare  he  can re-record to make the dialogue funnier  or  their  lead character animator pitches an idea that's just too perfect to not undergo the added work of rewriting and re-recording to implement it   they  can rest sure in the knowledge that Watson's left room for that"", ""In fact  she says she's prepared for the game to be at least  percent improvised"", 'She even incorporated that immediate feedback loop of a game jam  so that whenever  Roiland  re-records or runs with a piece of feedback  they can implement it and make it playable within single day', 'That means  Roiland

the experience of  Roiland 's comedic approach"", '""That absurdity makes you especially uncomfortable when you\'re actually part of it "" she says', '""VR contributes to the comedy because  whenever the player feels uncomfortable  that moment of release when they get to laugh just feels so good', 'For  Roiland   the VR bug really took over him once he first tried room-scale on the Vive', 'He\'d

In lieu of a direct answer to her question   Newton  smiled  laughed and said:
She was trying too hard asking if  Cam  enjoys  his  WRs being more physical and fighting for extra yards?  Poor Cam  having to answer that.  — Geoff Schwartz (@geoffschwartz) October   
Needless to say   Cam Newton  looks like a bigger clown than ever today. — Larry Holder (@LarryHolder) October   
Brutal  sexist answer from  Cam Newton  in response to good question from female reporter. And the body language was just as bad.  — RandBall (@RandBall) October   
What frustrates me about  Cam Newton 's comments:  He 's not joking around with friends   he 's being condescending to a reporter doing her job — Katherine Terrell (@Kat_Terrell) October   
“ The comments  are just plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalists who cover our league. They do not reflect the thinking of the league ” he said.
And yet  because we’re talking about women in sports  some people still don’t understand why what  Newton  said was wrong.
Why is people making a fuss about cam and the woman reporter  he  laughed than answered  her  question but it was funny first time for me to — Roddy White (@roddywhiteTV) October   
Everything about  Newton ’s response to Rodrigue’s question is baffling on so many levels. Not only is it insanely sexist but also incredibly unprofessional. We’ll get to  Newton ’s actual words in a second  but first pay attention to  his  body language and facial expression during the question.
As soon as Rodrigue starts asking her question   he  smirks and starts to fidget like  he ’s barely listening or taking her seriously. It’s more the behavior you’d expect from a dude trying to pick you up in a bar  not from a professional talking to another professional during the course of their job. It is condescending and belittles all women who work in sports media.
Add to that how  he  referred to Rodrigue as “a female”  like an object that can be easily all lumped together. By not having to acknowledge her as an individual  it makes it easier for  him  to dismiss her.
After the press conference  Rodrigue tweeted that she spoke to  Newton  about  his  comments and  he  did not apologize and frankly made the situation worse.
I spoke with  him  after and it was worse. I chose not to share  because I have an actual job to do today and one  he  will not keep me from. — Jourdan Rodrigue (@JourdanRodrigue) October   
The team released a statement contrary to that  saying that  Newton  “expressed regret for using those words.”
Here’s the thing   Newton  can say all  he  wants that  he ’s sorry for  his  words  but it’s clear that  he  has no idea why what  he  did was wrong. Let’s forget for a second that  he  was dumb enough to even utter those words  but what  he  said and the way  he  said it suggests that  his  sexism is so deeply internalized  he  doesn’t have a clue as to why it’s really problematic.","['During  his  weekly press conference on Wednesday the Carolina Panthers’  Cam Newton  took a question about routes from Charlotte Observer beat writer Jourdan Rodrigue.', 'In lieu of a direct answer to her question   Newton  smiled  laughed and said:', 'She was trying too hard asking if  Cam  enjoys  his  WRs being more physical and fighting for extra yards?

4166,test,"This is the second attempt to pass the H- visa-workers bill out of the House Judiciary Committee  which is chaired by  Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte .  His  Virginia district includes several turkey and chicken processing plants which employ many low-wage migrants and refugees. The prior vote was canceled October   when the farm-industry lobbyists could not win enough votes from reluctant Republican and Democratic legislators.
The committee tried to weaken opposition by announcing the surprise vote on Monday  one day before the planned Tuesday-morning session.  Goodlatte  has also scheduled time for a vote on Wednesday  giving more time for the industry lobbyists to strong-arm legislators.
If  Goodlatte ’s bill allowed farm workers to get citizenship  most would quickly migrate into towns to compete for better jobs. That migration would force down wages paid to urban Americans  and would also leave the farms free to replace the departed workers with another wave of temporary or illegal workers.
To win the support of pro-American reformers and voters   Goodlatte ’s bill is being packaged with a popular bill that would require companies to verify that new hires can legally work in the United States. That is a top priority for immigration reforms groups because it would reduce the iring of illegal immigrants and force up wages for Americans. The “E-verify” bill was developed by Texas Rep. Lamar Smith  and it titled the Legal Workforce Act.

Schwerner's widow  Rita Schwerner Bender  said on the day  Killen  was convicted that the slayings were part of a larger problem of violence in Mississippi against black people and others who challenged the segregationist status quo.
"" Preacher Killen  did not act in a vacuum and the members of the Klan who were members of the police department and the sheriff's department and the highway patrol didn't act in a vacuum "" she said.
Goodman said Friday that  Killen 's passing is a reminder that issues of racism and white nationalism remain today. He pointed to the violent rally of white nationalists in Charlottesville  Virginia  as an example.
 Killen  wouldn't say much about the killings during a  interview with The Associated Press inside the penitentiary.  He  said  he  remained a segregationist who did not believe in racial equality  but contended  he  harbored no ill will toward black people.  Killen  said  he  never had talked about the events that landed  him  behind bars  and never would.
Long a suspect in the  slayings   Killen  had made a livelihood from farming  operating  his  sawmill and preaching to a small congregation at Smyrna Baptist Church in Union  south of Philadelphia  Mississippi.
According to FBI files and court transcripts from a  federal conspiracy trial   Killen  did most of the planning in the ambush killings of the civil rights workers. According to testimony in the  murder trial   Killen  served as a kleagle  or organizer  of the Klan in Neshoba County and helped set up a klavern  or local Klan group  in a nearby county.
Nineteen men  including  Killen   were indicted on federal charges in the  case. Seven were convicted of violating the victims' civil rights. None served more than six years.
 Killen 's federal case ended with a hung jury after one juror said she couldn't convict a preacher. During  his  state trial in   witnesses testified that on June      Killen  went to Meridian to round up carloads of Klansmen to ambush Schwerner  Chaney and Goodman  telling some of the Klan members to bring plastic or rubber gloves. Witnesses said  Killen  then went to a Philadelphia funeral home as an alibi while the fatal attack occurred.
In February    Killen  sued the FBI  claiming the government used a mafia hit man to pistol-whip and intimidate witnesses for information in the case. The federal lawsuit sought millions of dollars in damages and a declaration that his rights were violated when the FBI allegedly used a gangster known as ""The Grim Reaper"" during the investigation. The lawsuit was later dismissed.
In the AP interview   Killen  repeated  his  contention that  he  was not a criminal  but a political prisoner.  He  spoke of  his  many friends  Sen. Eastland among them. Of one thing  he  was certain: ""I could have beat that thing if I'd had the mental ability.""

4178,test,"House Speaker Paul Ryan  says the nation needs a policy of “merit-based immigration ” marking a rhetorical shift towards President Donald Trump’s popular pro-American immigration policy.
“Ultimately  I think we should go to a merit-based immigration system ”  Ryan  declared during a January interview at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
But immigration reformers suspect  Ryan ’s statement is merely a rhetorical shift — and may even be political cover for a quick budget-deal sellout of Trump’s steady demand that protections and offsets be packaged with any amnesty for some or all of the . million ‘dreamer’ illegal immigrants.
“He’s not endorsing the  RAISE Act… which would reduce overall immigration ” noted Mark Krikorian  director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “It is perfectly consistent with the way  Ryan  sees immigration — to accept merit-based immigration but just make sure the numbers are very high ” said Krikorian  who prefers an immigration cutback to help raise Americans’ wages.
But  Ryan  also defines “merit” downwards to include people who can work at a Wisconsin dairy farm or in California vegetable field. That definition is far below reformers’ definition of “merit” as a person with rare and valuable technical or scientific skills.
 Ryan ’s support for unskilled “merit” cheap labor also suggests that  he  will not support a new House bill which reduces overall immigration unless there is more pressure from voters and GOP legislators in the run-up to a  midterm election. The House GOP bill would deal with the problem created by millions of illegal immigrants who brought roughly . million children to the United States. Democrats have labeled those now-grown illegals as ‘dreamers’ and are threatening to block the government’s  budget unless the illegals are allowed to become citizens. The House bill would provide three-year work permits to   of the illegals — but would not provide green cards or citizenship. The bill would also implement a series of reforms to deter and block future illegal immigration  and would it reduce nudge up wages by reducing the annual inflow of legal immigrants by roughly   people  to around   per year. “We need higher wages — that is the most important thing ” said Rep. Raul Labrador  the co-author of the GOP immigration-and-amnesty bill  titled the “Securing America’s Future Act.”
But  Ryan  is quietly resisting the Trump-endorsed low-immigration/high-wages legislation  according to Politico:
House Republicans are pressing  Ryan  for a vote on a partisan immigration bill that has little chance of passing the Senate. They want floor action on legislation by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.)  which goes well beyond what the White House has said should be in a deal codifying the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program into law — and which is unlikely to garner a single Democratic vote. “It’s a good bill…I think it’s something that bears consideration by the entire House ” said Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas)  a former leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee. “If I were the majority leader… I would recommend that we bring it” to the floor.  Ryan  and  his  top lieutenants have not committed to a vote on the Goodlatte bill  which GOP leaders worry could undermine bipartisan negotiations. And they’re not even sure the text could garner the  GOP votes needed for passage in the House. Still  he’s risking a backlash from conservatives if he doesn’t put it forward for a vote.  Ryan  explained  his  view of immigration policy on January .  Ryan  started  his  interview comments by praising America’s history of immigration  saying: My family  like a whole lot of people  came from Ireland on what they called coffin ships and came here and worked the railroads. The Irish were really looked down upon in those days. Then  he  suggested that large-scale immigration is a central part of the United States’ collective power  regardless of its damaging impact on Americans’ wages and their stable civic culture.  His  own family’s history “is a beautiful story of America … it is what makes this country so exceptionally unique in the first place … it is a big part of our strength ”  he  declared. The primary focus on  Ryan ’s comments was  his  eagerness to import more skilled or unskilled foreigners for companies in the United States  including the Chinese company  Foxconn  which announced in  it would open a huge  high-tech factory in  Ryan ’s home state. For  Ryan   “merit” means useful for companies: Ultimately  I think we should go to a merit-based immigration system and the reason I say that is — we fixate on labor force  and I was talking about workforce development  if we get every single able-bodied American who is not now working or looking for work  you know  and close the skills gap  get them from poverty to the workfrce  we’re still going to be needing  people in this country … I am just saying I think we need to rework our immigration system so that the visas are not given based on  relations other than the nuclear family  but are based on skills  based on what we need. We are going to need people with our dairy industry in Western Wisconsin  they need people in the vegetable industry in California  we’re going to need — after we find every software single software engineer in southeastern Wisconsin for Foxconn  we’re going to need more  that kind of thing. So that’s why I’d like to take this opportunity to fix this particular  problem — which does need to get fixed and also try to knock down some of the other problems so we can get some solutions here.
 Ryan  has repeatedly endorsed the importation of more unskilled refugees to work as government-subsidized dairy workers  even though American-built cow-milking robots are being sold to farmers in  his  home state.
In passing   Ryan  also seemed to oppose Trump’s policy of returning roughly   migrants El Salvador who were given “Temporary Protected Status” when their home nation was hit by earthquakes in . Most of the migrants are poorly educated and most were already illegal immigrants when the earthquake hit  but  Ryan  appears to support their continued presence  as  he  showed in this exchange with the host:
Q: You don’t want to ship   El Salvadoreans …  Ryan : Yeah  right  that’s the TPS thing… Q. … that exacerbates the labor shortage.  Ryan : Correct.

4185,test,"Two days before the Inauguration of Donald Trump as  the forty-fifth President of the United States  Michael Flynn  a retired lieutenant general and former intelligence officer   sat down in a Washington restaurant. On the tablecloth   he  placed a leather-bound folder and two phones  which flashed with text messages and incoming calls. A gaunt  stern-looking man with hooded eyes and a Roman nose  Flynn is sharp in both manner and language. He had been one of Trump’s earliest supporters  a vociferous booster on television  on Twitter  and  most memorably  from the stage of the Republican National Convention. Strident views and a penchant for conspiracy theories often embroiled him in controversy—in a hacked e-mail from last summer  former Secretary of State Colin Powell called him “right-wing nutty”—but Trump rewarded  Flynn ’s loyalty by making him his national-security adviser. Now  after months of unrelenting scrutiny   Flynn  seemed to believe that  he  could find a measure of obscurity in the West Wing  steps away from Trump and the Oval Office. “I want to go back to having an out-of-sight role ”  he  told me. That ambition proved illusory. Three weeks into  his  job  the Washington Post revealed that  Flynn   while  he  was still a private citizen and Barack Obama was still President  had discussed American sanctions against Russia with Sergey Kislyak  the Russian Ambassador in Washington. The conversations were possibly illegal.  Flynn  and Kislyak’s communications  by phone and text  occurred on the same day the Obama Administration announced the expulsion of thirty-five Russian diplomats in retaliation for Russia’s efforts to swing the election in Trump’s favor.  Flynn  had previously denied talking about sanctions with the Ambassador. At the restaurant   he  said that  he  didn’t think there was anything untoward about the call: “I’ve had a relationship with  him  since my days at the D.I.A.”—the Defense Intelligence Agency  which  Flynn  directed from  to . But  in a classic Washington spectacle of action followed by coverup followed by collapse   Flynn  soon started backpedalling  saying  through a spokesman  that  he  “couldn’t be certain that the topic  never came up.”  He  compounded  his  predicament by making the same denial to Vice-President Mike Pence  who repeated it on television.  Flynn  later apologized to Pence. But by then  his  transgressions had been made public. In a White House characterized by chaos and conflict—a Byzantine court led by a reality-television star  family members  and a circle of ideologues and loyalists— Flynn  was finished. The episode created countless concerns  about the President’s truthfulness  competence  temperament  and associations. How much did Trump know and when did he know it? John McCain  a Republican and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  said that the fiasco was a “troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national-security apparatus” and raised “further questions” about the Trump Administration’s intentions regarding Vladimir Putin’s Russia. In one of several recent conversations  Flynn told me  “We have to figure out how to work with Russia instead of making it an enemy. We have so many problems that we were handed on a plate from this President”—meaning Obama. He lifted a bread plate and waved it. He characterized the negative attention on him as part of a larger conspiracy against Trump. “I’m a target to get at Trump to delegitimize the election ” he said. The press had him “damn near all wrong.” Reporters were just chasing after wild theories  while neglecting to consider his career as a decorated Army officer. “You don’t just sprinkle magic dust on someone  and  poof   they become a three-star general ” he said. But  even before  Flynn ’s rapid fall   his  closest military colleagues had been struggling to make sense of what had happened to the talented and grounded general they once knew. “Mike is inarguably one of the finest leaders the Army has ever produced ” James (Spider) Marks  a retired major general  told me. And yet  watching the first night of the Republican National Convention  last July  Marks was taken aback when his old friend appeared onscreen. “Wake up  America!”  Flynn  said   his  jaw set and  his  hands gripping the sides of the lectern. The United States was in peril: “Our very existence is threatened.” The moment demanded a President with “guts ” he declared  not a “weak  spineless” one who “believes she is above the law.” In the early two-thousands  Marks was  Flynn ’s commanding officer at the Army’s intelligence academy  in Fort Huachuca  Arizona; one of his daughters went to school with one of  Flynn ’s sons. Marks regarded  Flynn  as “smart  humble  and funny.” What he saw on TV was something else: “That’s a vitriolic side of Mike that I never knew.” When  twenty minutes into the speech   Flynn  mentioned Hillary Clinton  the Convention audience responded with chants of “Lock her up!”  Flynn  nodded  leading the chant: “That’s right—lock her up.”  He  went on  “Damn right. . . . And you know why we’re saying that? We’re saying that because  if I  a guy who knows this business  if I did a tenth—a tenth—of what she did  I would be in jail today.” Marks’s thirty-five-year-old daughter  who was watching with him  turned to her father and said  “ Dad  General Flynn is scaring me.”
Trump  in his inaugural address  presented a dire image of the country—a nation suffering from poverty and blight  overextended abroad  and neglectful of its own citizens. He pledged to end the “carnage” by putting “America first”—echoing the isolationist creed of the nineteen-thirties. The beginning of Trump’s Presidency remained true to his campaign: even when it came to the highly sensitive issues of national security  Trump and his aides acted with ideological ferocity and a heedless sense of procedure that alarmed many inside the government. The Trump Administration’s early days have invited comparison to the most unnerving political moments in memory  particularly Richard Nixon’s behavior during the Watergate scandal. On January   a week after taking office  Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions and temporarily banning entry to citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. His chief political strategist  Stephen Bannon  reportedly oversaw the crafting of the order  along with Stephen Miller  the White House’s senior policy adviser. (Miller disputes this.)  Flynn  raised some concerns about how the order might affect relationships with allies  but those were ignored. James Mattis  the Secretary of Defense  and General Joseph Dunford  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  received little notice of the order. The next day  Trump signed another executive order  reorganizing the National Security Council. He promoted Bannon  a former investment banker and chairman of the far-right Web site Breitbart News  to a permanent seat on the “principals committee.” Elevating a political adviser to national-security policymaking marked a radical departure from the practice of recent Administrations. “I said  ‘Fetch Chardonnay ’ not ‘Riesling.’ ” By this point  the Justice Department had informed Trump officials of concerns about  Flynn ’s conversations with the Russian Ambassador and his public accounting of them. The acting Attorney General  Sally Yates  a holdover from the Obama Administration  told the White House that she worried  Flynn  might be vulnerable to blackmail by Russian agents  the Washington Post reported. Yet  Flynn  remained an important player in national-security matters. “ He  was always in the room  and on every call ” one Administration official told me. Each morning   Flynn  attended Trump’s intelligence briefing—the President’s Daily Brief. Bannon joined occasionally  as did Mike Pompeo  the director of the C.I.A.  and Reince Priebus  the White House chief of staff.  Flynn  conferred with senior intelligence officials on how to best tailor the briefing for Trump. Presidents are particular about how they receive information  Michael Morell  a former acting C.I.A. director  who prepared and delivered the President’s Daily Brief to several Presidents  told me. George H. W. Bush preferred text on a half page  in a single column  limited to four or five pages; George W. Bush liked his briefs fifteen to twenty pages long  and preferred his briefer to stay in the room while he read the document; Barack Obama studied the material alone  over breakfast. Trump’s briefings were being shaped to address macroeconomics  trade  and “alliances ”  Flynn  told me  in a telephone conversation earlier this month. “The P.D.B. is not always about just your enemies.” Congress created the National Security Council in   in the hope of establishing a more orderly process for coördinating foreign and defense policy. Six years later  Dwight Eisenhower decided that the council needed a chief and named the first national-security adviser—a former soldier and banker  Robert Cutler. The position evolved into one of enormous importance. McGeorge Bundy  who served under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson  regarded himself as a “traffic cop”—controlling access to the President. Under Richard Nixon  Henry Kissinger dramatically expanded the role  often meeting directly with the Soviet Ambassador  and bypassing the State Department. The temptations of power nearly overwhelmed Ronald Reagan’s Presidency  in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair  when national-security staffers were discovered to be running covert actions involving Iran and Central America. The scandal prompted some to call for the national-security adviser to become a Senate-confirmed position. Heading off these demands  George H. W. Bush chose a retired general  Brent Scowcroft  who had held the job under Gerald Ford  to return to the role  confident that Scowcroft would respect the lines between intelligence work  military operations  and policymaking. “He will be an honest broker ” Bush said. Since then  according to Stephen Hadley  George W. Bush’s second-term national-security adviser  the “honest broker” has become the model for Republican and Democratic Administrations alike. That meant overseeing a process that is “fair and transparent  where each member of the council can get his views to the President ” Hadley said. In late November  Hadley met with  Flynn   who was seeking advice  at Trump Tower. Hadley left the meeting optimistic that  Flynn  meant to act as a facilitator in the traditional way. But  Flynn ’s challenge—and now  potentially   his  successor’s—was unique  as Bannon had seemingly moved to set up a kind of “parallel  shadow” national-security staff for  his  own purposes  one council staffer told me. Bannon  who had no direct experience in policymaking  seized a central role on issues dear to Trump. For example  during the campaign Trump had railed against NATO members for not paying their full freight  which unnerved diplomats and politicians throughout Europe. On February   according to the staffer  Bannon sent questions to the N.S.C. staff  requesting a breakdown of contributions to NATO from individual members since . Many of the rank-and-file staffers were alarmed  not just because the questions seemed designed to impugn NATO ’s legitimacy but because they represented a breach of protocol by tasking N.S.C. staffers with political duties. “Those were  Flynn ’s people  not political operatives ” the staffer said.  Flynn  came into the White House wanting to streamline the bureaucracy of the N.S.C.  which is staffed mostly by career civil servants from the State Department  the Pentagon  and intelligence agencies  believing that it moved too ponderously under Obama. But  Flynn   in a contest for power with Bannon  soon seemed to realize that the traditional setup could help him build influence in the White House. “It was dawning on him that the process privileged him ” the N.S.C. staffer said. Others in the White House treated the customary protocols as impediments. “We are moving big and we are moving fast ” Bannon said  according to the Times . Before  Flynn ’s troubles mounted  I asked  him  whether it was appropriate for Bannon to have a permanent seat on the N.S.C.  He  paused. “Well  I mean  that decision’s been made ”  he  said. Besides  didn’t other political advisers enjoy similar access?  He  brought up Valerie Jarrett  a senior adviser to Obama. Jarrett did not have a seat on the National Security Council  I said. “She didn’t? How about  like  Axelrod? He was Clinton  right?” (David Axelrod  who was Obama’s chief strategist  sometimes sat in on N.S.C. meetings but did not participate in policymaking discussions.) Look   Flynn  said  “the President shapes the team that he needs to be able to do the job that he has to do. So that’s kind of where we are on that one.”
 Flynn  grew up in a large Irish-American household  in Middletown  Rhode Island.  He  was one of nine children.  His  father was a soldier  a veteran of the Second World War and Korea  who retired as a sergeant first class in the Army;  his  mother  a high-school valedictorian  worked at a secretarial school and was heavily involved in Democratic politics  before going back to school to get undergraduate and law degrees. A headstrong teen-ager   Flynn  skateboarded in drained swimming pools and surfed through hurricanes and winter storms. “Mike was a charger ” Sid Abruzzi  a surf-shop owner in nearby Newport  who knew  Flynn  as a teen-ager  said. In   after graduating from the University of Rhode Island   Flynn  joined the Army. He qualified as an intelligence officer  and got orders to join the  Airborne Division  a paratrooper unit in Fort Bragg  North Carolina. In    Flynn  deployed to Grenada  as part of the American invasion force. He set up a listening post on a cliffside to intercept Cuban radio transmissions. One day  spotting two American soldiers being swept out to sea   Flynn  leaped off the cliff—“about a forty-foot jump into the swirling waters ”  he  recalls  in  his  book  “The Field of Fight”—and rescued the men.  He  won a rapid series of promotions. In    he  helped plan operations in support of the American invasion of Haiti. After that   he  rotated to Fort Polk  Louisiana  the site of an Army base for urban-combat and special-operations training. In    he  deployed to Iraq with the Joint Special Operations Command  an élite counterterrorism unit composed of operators from the Delta Force  Rangers  SEAL Team Six  and others. Its culture is unusual in the military: rank is respected but not revered; sergeants challenge colonels  and colonels challenge generals.  Flynn   then a colonel  in charge of the command’s intelligence collection and analysis  had ambitions for expanding the reach of special operations. He considered the command’s operators expert killers—“the best spear fishermen in the world.” But  in order to quell the insurgency spreading in Iraq  they would have to become “net fishermen ” taking down terrorist networks  he said  in a  interview. “I feel like everybody’s podcasting and nobody’s podlistening.”  Flynn  encouraged  his  men to think more like detectives as they hunted Al Qaeda militants; he brought F.B.I. agents in to instruct operators in how to collect and preserve evidence. A former Ranger recalled storming a house  flex-cuffing the tenants  then staying for several hours  risking exposure  while he and his teammates searched behind walls and under mattresses for a single thumb drive—which they found  eventually  in a pipe beneath the kitchen sink. Intelligence operatives would gather information by hacking militants’ computers  intercepting their phone calls  and surveilling them with drones. “We were able to mass so much information against individuals we captured that at some point they realized it was no use lying to us anymore ”  Flynn  says  in “Twilight Warriors: The Soldiers  Spies  and Special Agents Who Are Revolutionizing the American Way of War ” by James Kitfield. On the afternoon of April     American soldiers helicoptered into Yusufiyah  a town outside Baghdad. They raided a suspected Al Qaeda safe house and detained twelve middle-aged men  who were taken to Balad Air Base  the site of the command’s Iraq headquarters  for questioning.  Flynn  observed some of the interviews. Over weeks of interrogation  the prisoners repeatedly denied knowing anything about Al Qaeda or its leader in Iraq  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Finally  two interrogators confronted one of the prisoners about a trip to Amman  Jordan  just before the devastating hotel bombings the previous year. The prisoner started talking  and divulged the identity of Zarqawi’s spiritual adviser and where to find him. Drones tracked the adviser for weeks. One day  the man came out of his house and got into a silver sedan. After two vehicle switches  he pulled into a compound in Hibhib  thirty miles north of Baghdad. A few minutes after the adviser arrived  another man emerged briefly from the house. He matched the description of Zarqawi. As  Flynn  and his boss  General Stanley McChrystal  JSOC ’s commander  watched on a video feed  an F- dropped two bombs on the house. A Delta Force squad quickly arrived at the scene and seized Zarqawi  who died soon afterward. Back at Balad   Flynn  and McChrystal inspected the corpse  laid out on a tarp  confirming that it was Zarqawi.
In    Flynn  got a new assignment  at the Pentagon  as the senior intelligence officer reporting to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was an awkward fit.  Flynn   now a major general  was unfamiliar with ordinary Pentagon decorum and sometimes struggled to summon the diplomacy required for the job. Intelligence officers are often irascible figures. “We are trained to be contrarians ” Marks  the retired major general  who was the senior intelligence officer during the invasion of Iraq  said. “I’m the only guy in the room who gets paid to tell you that you’re not as handsome or as smart as you think you are. I’m the one who looks the boss in the eye and says  ‘Your plan is all fucked up.’ ” In November    Obama won the Presidency  having pledged to draw down troops in Iraq and shift military resources back to Afghanistan. He chose McChrystal to lead American forces in Afghanistan. McChrystal asked his friend  Flynn  to become his director of intelligence. Their collaboration in Iraq had severely crippled Al Qaeda. In Afghanistan  though  the terrain was less familiar  and their mission quite different  with a much greater emphasis on winning “hearts and minds.” Still   Flynn  was thrilled to be heading to the battlefield again. According to a friend  when  she  asked  Flynn  whether he’d regret missing an almost certain promotion in Washington  he replied  “Are you kidding me? I get to go back to the shit with Stan.” He landed in Afghanistan in June  . His office was a windowless converted shipping container  and during long days he took briefings and pored over classified assessments.  Flynn  often ate his meals in the chow hall and chatted with subordinates. “I have no recollection of any other general officers doing that ” Toni Gidwani  an intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  in Afghanistan  told me.  Flynn  was intense  but  he  was also funny and “called bullshit when  he  saw it ” according to Vikram Singh  who is now at the Center for American Progress  and at the time was advising Richard Holbrooke  Obama’s chief envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Flynn ’s directives  however  could at times be difficult to follow.  His  talent for absorbing information could race ahead of  his  analytical abilities. “ He  is not a linear thinker ” an intelligence analyst who served on multiple assignments with  Flynn  said. Stephen Biddle  a defense-policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations  recounted late-night meetings in  Flynn ’s container: “His ideas and assessments kept moving around.” Max Boot  a civilian adviser in Afghanistan at the time  told me that  Flynn  got “jerked around by the data”—he would contend that the Taliban were nearly defeated and then  with no less conviction  argue that the militant group was stronger than ever. Part of the challenge was the shortage of reliable intelligence in Afghanistan.  Flynn  considered some of the C.I.A.’s activities counterproductive. When Ahmed Wali Karzai  the brother of President Hamid Karzai and a suspected drug trafficker  was revealed as a longtime C.I.A. asset   Flynn  voiced  his  displeasure with the agency  telling the Times   “If we are going to conduct a population-centric strategy in Afghanistan  and we are perceived as backing thugs  then we are just undermining ourselves.”  Flynn  dispatched a Marine Corps first lieutenant to travel around the country interviewing marines  soldiers  and civilian partners about their intelligence needs. The lieutenant  Matthew Pottinger  had been a Beijing correspondent for the Wall Street Journal before enlisting as an intelligence officer in the Marines. Throughout the autumn of   Pottinger crisscrossed the country. What he heard was dispiriting. An operations officer told him that his knowledge of what was happening in villages was “no more than fingernail deep.” The Americans were ignorant of local power brokers  religious practices  and economics. Pottinger   Flynn   and a senior official from the Defense Intelligence Agency compiled their observations  along with recommendations for changes  into a damning report. In late December  Flynn e-mailed the report to dozens of colleagues at the Pentagon  the White House  and the C.I.A. The response was underwhelming; most didn’t even bother to reply. Pottinger suggested finding a publisher outside the government  and  Flynn  agreed. On January     the Center for a New American Security  a progressive think tank  released “Fixing Intel: A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan.” Reviews outside the military were laudatory  but senior Pentagon and C.I.A. officials were angered by  Flynn ’s decision to go public. “I was very concerned about an intelligence officer openly criticizing our intelligence community ” former C.I.A. director Leon Panetta told me.  Flynn  and Pottinger understood that they might be fired. Defense Secretary Robert Gates delivered a judgment of the report that saved them. He called it “exactly the type of candid  critical self-assessment” that the military needed. “Fixing Intel” consolidated  Flynn ’s exalted status in the intelligence community. In   Defense News ranked him seventeenth on its “ Most Influential” list  heralding the report as something that “might have ended his career” but which  instead  “accelerated it.”
Three months after “Fixing Intel” was published  McChrystal and some members of his staff flew to Paris to strengthen support for the war among French officials.  Flynn  stayed behind in Afghanistan. A Rolling Stone reporter who had been spending time with McChrystal joined him on the trip and heard him and his staff speaking derisively about the political leadership in Washington  and witnessed them getting drunk one night at an Irish pub. In mid-June    the magazine piece  “The Runaway General ” appeared. McChrystal was quoted calling Vice-President Joe Biden “shortsighted” for his opposition to the surge in Afghanistan; one aide mocked Biden as “Bite Me”; and another aide dismissed Jim Jones  Obama’s first national-security adviser  as a “clown.” Obama fired McChrystal the day after publication.  Flynn  chafed at the decision. “It’s hard to see someone you know have to go through that ” a close associate of  Flynn ’s told me. “You don’t heal from that overnight.”  Flynn  prepared to leave Afghanistan  as McChrystal’s successor  David Petraeus  brought in his own staff. Before  Flynn  departed   he  stopped by the Joint Intelligence Operations Center to say goodbye. Speaking to dozens of analysts   Flynn  delivered a forty-five-minute lesson  covering some of the bloodiest engagements in American history: the Battle of Antietam  in   when twenty-three thousand people were killed or wounded in a single day; Operation Torch  in   when several hundred soldiers died establishing beachheads in North Africa as part of the Allied invasion. “His point was that no one in Washington can ever appreciate what is happening on the battlefield  and that there aren’t as many Americans dying now as before ” the intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  said. “But it was confusing  and these would be the same kind of discussions you’d have with him about the nature of the insurgency—you’d leave his office and spend an hour trying to figure out what he was trying to say.” Back in Washington   Flynn  was assigned to the office of James Clapper  the director of national intelligence.  Flynn ’s success in Iraq and Afghanistan made  him  popular in foreign-policy circles. In April     he  attended a luncheon at the Army and Navy Club  a members-only hotel and restaurant two blocks from the White House. About two dozen guests sat in a private room  around a long table. Iran was a major focus of the conversation  according to one of the event’s hosts  Mary Beth Long  a former C.I.A. case officer and a senior Pentagon official during the George W. Bush Administration. The attendees included a neoconservative historian named Michael Ledeen  who was then a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute  a Washington think tank. Ledeen had been obsessed with Iran for decades. In the mid-eighties  as a consultant to Reagan’s National Security Council  he played a central role in the Iran-Contra affair—introducing Oliver North  Reagan’s counterterrorism adviser  to Manucher Ghorbanifar  an Iranian arms dealer. Ledeen’s hope had been to stir up dissent inside Iran through Ghorbanifar’s network of influential contacts  according to the Presidential commission that investigated the affair. (Ledeen disputes this.) Instead  Ghorbanifar wound up as the middleman in the sale of weapons to Iran  in exchange for Tehran’s assistance in freeing American hostages held by Iranian-backed Islamists in Lebanon. But Ledeen’s zeal for regime change in Iran remained undiminished. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq  he called for American forces to press on  into Iran. “As Ronald Reagan once said  ‘America is too great a country to settle for small dreams ’ ” he wrote  in . Iraq was a distraction; Iran was “the real war.”  Flynn   too  increasingly viewed Iran as a great menace. In Iraq  he had seen scores of young Americans killed by sophisticated armor-piercing explosives  supplied to Shiite militias by the Quds Force  an élite unit of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Flynn  and Ledeen became close friends; in their shared view of the world  Ledeen supplied an intellectual and historical perspective   Flynn  a tactical one. “I’ve spent my professional life studying evil ” Ledeen told me.  Flynn  said  in a recent speech  “I’ve sat down with really  really evil people”—he cited Al Qaeda  the Taliban  Russians  Chinese generals—“and all I want to do is punch the guy in the nose.” A month after the luncheon  a team of Navy SEAL s raided a compound in Abbotabad  Pakistan  and killed Osama bin Laden.  Flynn  was critical of the limitations placed on intelligence work after the raid. Analysts had spent several weeks going through the hard drives and phones seized in the raid looking for “targeting data”—clues on the whereabouts of other terrorists—and leads on imminent threats. But  Flynn  and others advocated going deeper  with the hope of learning more about Al Qaeda’s finances and backers and organizational structure. A team returned to the materials and uncovered documents that seemed to point to a closer relationship between Al Qaeda and Iran than was previously understood. In one memorandum  a lieutenant asks bin Laden for permission to send an associate planning attacks in Europe into Iran for “around three months” to “train the brothers.”  Flynn  saw such references as evidence of Iran’s duplicity  in supporting Shiite and Sunni extremists alike. It seemed validation of Ledeen’s views on Iran. (Others in the intelligence community  including Panetta  the C.I.A. director at the time of the raid  were dubious about a close relationship between Al Qaeda and Iran.) James Mattis  the Marine general in charge of U.S. Central Command  whose responsibilities included the Middle East and Central Asia  had been pushing for more aggressive action against Iran. In the summer of   Mattis  who is now the Secretary of Defense  wanted to launch a rocket assault on an Iranian power plant in retaliation for the killing of six American soldiers by Iranian rockets in Baghdad. But the Obama Administration was hoping to get out of the Middle East  not risk starting another war there.  Flynn  felt that the Administration was being naïve  and that no one seemed to care about what  he  insisted was the collusion between Al Qaeda and Iran. “ He  was incensed ” an analyst who worked with  Flynn  at the time said. “ He  saw this as truth suppression.”
In April    Obama nominated  Flynn  to be the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Within the intelligence community  the agency was considered a backwater. “It’s the bastard child ” Mary Beth Long  the former C.I.A. officer  said. The agency  whose headquarters are in southwest Washington  produced reports on topics like Middle Eastern weapons deals  changes of command in China  and troop movements on the Korean peninsula—essential work for assessing foreign military capabilities but hardly exciting. To invigorate the D.I.A.   Flynn  wanted to break down the barriers between collectors and analysts; enhance the stable of clandestine case officers who operated overseas  like their C.I.A. counterparts; and reorganize the agency on the basis of geography. The goal was to transform the D.I.A. into a more agile organization.  Flynn ’s ideas were informed by  his  experience in helping to overhaul JSOC . But it was unclear whether they would work at the D.I.A.  with seventeen thousand employees. “ JSOC has a small  tight-knit group of folks making real-time tactical decisions that must be executed tonight  ” a senior military intelligence official told me. “A big organization like the D.I.A. just can’t respond that quickly.” Peter Shelby  a retired marine and former D.I.A. official  told me he assumed that  Flynn  would be methodical in his approach: spend a few months at headquarters; learn how the organization worked; cultivate respected agency veterans; and then introduce changes. Instead  Shelby said  “ Flynn  came in and threw a bomb to explode the whole place  and then just let the dust settle.” Employees started to complain. Many sought reassignment with other agencies. “Morale was in the toilet ” Shelby said. “To higher-level observers   Flynn  looked like this bold leader  willing to make changes in the face of opposition. But  the further down you went  the more negative impact there was  because it was complete chaos.” “I said  ‘I wonder what it means ’ not ‘Tell me what it means.’ ” Moreover   Flynn  could be sloppy with numbers and details—misstatements that  his  staffers derided as “ Flynn  facts.”  His  habit of chasing hunches also exasperated some staff members. In September    after the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate and annex in Benghazi   Flynn  urged an investigation into an Iran connection;  his  insistence that Iran was involved “stunned” subordinates  according to the Times . ( Flynn  denies that  he  asked for a probe.) An intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  during this period told me that his iconoclasm sometimes went too far. “By nature   Flynn  takes a contrarian approach to even the most simple analytic issues ” the analyst said. “After Benghazi  I remember him using the phrase ‘black swan’ a lot. What’s a ‘black swan’? He was looking for the random event that nobody could predict. Look  you certainly have to keep your eye on the ball for that  but there’s a reason why it’s a black swan . You shouldn’t dedicate a ton of time to that.” In    Flynn  arranged a trip to Moscow to speak to a group of officers from the G.R.U.  Russia’s intelligence agency  about leadership development. His decision to go was a controversial one.  Flynn  believed that there were opportunities to find common ground with Russia. But Steven Hall  the C.I.A.’s chief of Russia operations at the time  was skeptical. “He wanted to build a relationship with his counterparts in the G.R.U.  which seemed  at best  quaint and naïve ” Hall told me. “Every time we have tried to have some sort of meaningful coöperation with the Russians  it’s almost always been manipulated and turned back against us.” Several months after  Flynn  returned from  his  Moscow trip   he  hoped to reciprocate by inviting several senior G.R.U. officers to the United States. Clapper  the director of national intelligence  cautioned  him  against it. Russia had recently annexed Crimea  and Russian special-forces operatives were fomenting a violent clash between rebels and Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine. By then   Flynn  had become a target of scorn for many inside the department. His deputy  David Shedd  became one of his harshest critics  and did little to hide his disdain. “I was walking by the front office once and heard David Shedd say  ‘I’m going to save the agency from the director ’ ” Simone Ledeen  who works in counter-threat finance at a multinational bank  said. Ledeen had worked for  Flynn  in Afghanistan  at the office for the director of national intelligence  and in the D.I.A.  doing threat-assessment research. (She is also Michael Ledeen’s daughter.) Normally  a D.I.A. director serves for three or more years  but  in late   Clapper and Michael Vickers  the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence  were concerned about the tumult inside the agency and told  Flynn  that  his  tenure would last just two years.  Flynn  unsuccessfully tried to extend  his  term when  his  successor’s nomination was delayed. Shedd later became the acting director. On August     at a ceremony in the atrium of the D.I.A.’s headquarters   Flynn  retired from the military  after thirty-three years. His wife and two sons attended  as did Michael Ledeen. The senior military intelligence official  who was present  told me that  Flynn  was obviously bitter: “He was loading up  and he was not going to go quietly.”
 Flynn   who was fifty-five  began fashioning a post-military life. He started his own business  the Flynn Intel Group  which offered clients a range of private intelligence and security services. He did some freelance consulting and also worked with SBD Advisors  a strategic consulting firm whose roster included the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen; former chief of the Special Operations Command Admiral Eric Olson; and other retired military officers. In January     Flynn  signed with Leading Authorities  a speakers’ bureau  which promoted  his  expertise in leadership  cybersecurity  and terrorism.  Flynn  began developing a public profile as a decorated former general with experience in fighting Islamic extremism. A month later   he  made an appearance on “Charlie Rose.”  He  spoke at length about the threat posed by the Islamic State  which had been executing hostages and rapidly acquiring territory in northern Iraq and Syria. But America faced bigger foes than isis    he  said. “Iran has killed more Americans than Al Qaeda has through state sponsors  through its terrorist network  called Hezbollah.” This was a puzzling assertion. “Hezbollah has killed more Americans than Al Qaeda?” Rose asked.  Flynn  began a count  starting with Hezbollah’s  bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that killed two hundred and eighty-three people.  He  cited other instances  but  his  math made little sense  and the numbers fell far short of the nearly three thousand killed by Al Qaeda’s attacks on /. Rose moved on  but a friend who had accompanied  Flynn  to the studio pulled  him  aside after the taping and questioned  his  Iran claim. One of Rose’s producers offered to fact-check the segment  but  he  waved off the suggestion. Another friend who’d come to the taping suggested contacting an expert from the intelligence community. That wouldn’t be necessary   Flynn  said— he  would just call Michael Ledeen.  Flynn  and Ledeen’s relationship soon became a professional collaboration.  Flynn  asked Ledeen to help  him  write a book.  Flynn  wanted to position  himself  as a sage counsellor for the upcoming Presidential campaign. Ledeen had written more than a dozen books  including five on Iran. They were often polemical works  with titles such as “The War Against the Terror Masters” and “The Iranian Time Bomb ” and were filled with sweeping statements like “Islamic fundamentalism  of which the ideology of the Iranian regime is a textbook case  draws much of its inspiration from Mussolini  Hitler  and Stalin.” In April     Flynn  accepted an invitation to spend a week at Dartmouth. Daniel Benjamin  a former State Department counterterrorism chief who now directed the school’s international-affairs center  had come to know  Flynn  in Afghanistan. He considered him friendly and engaging  and thought students and faculty would appreciate his insights and his unconventionality. He set up class visits  dinner discussions  and a talk  which  Flynn  titled “World Without Order.” Benjamin told me that he quickly realized during the visit that  Flynn ’s “easygoing pragmatism” had given way to some “very hard-edged ideas ” particularly on Iran.  Flynn  voiced contempt toward Iran’s leaders (“They are liars”) and said that they had “no right” to participate in negotiations with the United States over their nuclear program. (The Iran nuclear deal was signed in July  .) “I’ve encountered plenty of military officers who were deeply upset by the role that Iranian-backed militias played in Iraq  but  Flynn ’s animosity was off the charts ” Benjamin said.  Flynn  expressed similarly harsh views of Islam in general  describing the faith as a political ideology  and not a religion. Benjamin  who  in   co-wrote a book  “The Age of Sacred Terror ” about the ideological war that America faced against radical Islam  deemed  Flynn ’s comments “pointlessly pejorative” and thought they would serve only to inflame extremists. He began discouraging Dartmouth’s administrators and faculty from attending the events. On Fox News  NBC’s “Meet the Press ” CNN  and elsewhere   Flynn  became increasingly critical of the Obama Administration. He lashed out at the Iran nuclear deal  the Administration’s ISIS strategy  and its approach to radical Islam generally. Several Republican hopefuls preparing to run against Hillary Clinton asked for his advice. Carly Fiorina  the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive  brought  Flynn  on as an informal adviser for her Presidential bid. She told me that she found him refreshing. “He is a very down-to-earth  approachable guy ” she said. She was also impressed by his candor.  Flynn   she said  “doesn’t pull punches.” In August     Flynn  went to New York to meet Trump for the first time. They were scheduled to talk for thirty minutes; the conversation lasted ninety.  Flynn  was deeply impressed. “I knew  he  was going to be the President of the United States ”  he  told me. “Look  until there’s a Tinder for pandas  we have to meet the old-fashioned way: being locked in a room together by scientists.” Two months later   Flynn  appeared on RT  the English-language Russian television channel  formerly known as Russia Today. The outlet was widely regarded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin  even before a recent U.S. intelligence report on Russian hacking and the Presidential election said that the channel had become an important part of a “Kremlin-directed campaign to undermine faith in the US Government.”  Flynn  discussed the civil war in Syria  where Russian jets were flying bombing sorties in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  He  contrasted Putin’s resolve with what  he  described as Obama’s dithering in the region: “There’s no coherence or no clarity to the strategy.”
In early November    a D.C.-based representative of RT contacted  Flynn ’s speakers’ bureau and invited him to Moscow for the channel’s tenth-anniversary celebration. The fee was approximately forty thousand dollars  according to a source familiar with the arrangement. This trip was considerably more fraught than the one he had made as D.I.A. director. On December   RT issued a press release announcing  Flynn ’s participation. In e-mails  Simone Ledeen urged her former boss  and family friend  to reconsider. “I begged him  ‘Please  sir: don’t do this. It’s not just you. You’re a retired three-star general. It’s the Army. It’s all of the people who have been with you  all of these analysts known as “ Flynn ’s people.” Don’t do this to them. Don’t do this to yourself.’ ”  Flynn  assured  his  critics that  he  knew what  he  was doing. “Know my values and beliefs are mine & won’t change because I’m on a different piece of geography ”  he  tweeted. Before the trip   Flynn  received a classified counterespionage briefing at D.I.A. headquarters. Hall  the former C.I.A. chief of Russia operations  told me  “Whatever personal electronic device you carry with you into Russia will be compromised.”  Flynn  stayed at a hotel near Red Square. The RT gala featured speakers and panel discussions during the day and a dinner at night. That morning  Sophie Shevardnadze  an RT correspondent  interviewed  Flynn . From the stage  he confessed to feeling as if he were behind enemy lines. “I’m sort of in the lair ” he said. A Russian jet had recently been shot down near the Syrian border by a Turkish plane  and Shevardnadze asked  Flynn  how Russia should respond. “Are we not to react? What does Turkey expect?”  she  asked.  Circumspect  Flynn  said  “I don’t know what Turkey expects. I don’t know what Russia expects.”  Flynn  also seemed to go out of  his  way to tweak the Russian government and its partners in Damascus and Tehran. “Let’s face it  come on  is Assad the future of Syria  given the way the situation has unfolded?”  Flynn  said.  He  added that Assad’s allies in Iran were making things worse in Syria and elsewhere. “Iran exports a lot of terrorism ” he declared.  Flynn  was seated at the head table for dinner that evening. Putin sat to his left. Cyril Svoboda  the former foreign minister of the Czech Republic  sat to  Flynn ’s right. I called Svoboda  who speaks fluent English and Russian  and who translated a brief exchange between the two men  and asked what they discussed. “It was very  very short ” Svoboda said. “ ‘ Kak vashi dela ?’ ‘ Shto novovo ?’ ‘ Khorosho .’ ” (“How are you?” “What’s new?” “Good.”) After dinner  Putin went onstage and congratulated RT on its success. The Russian government wasn’t perfect  he said  so he appreciated RT for its presentation of “various points of view.” After Putin concluded his remarks   Flynn   joining other diners  stood and applauded. Last year   Flynn  talked to Dana Priest  of the Washington Post  about the trip. When Priest asked why he would go on RT  a state-run channel   Flynn  replied  “Well  what’s CNN?” “Well  it’s not run by the state ” Priest said. “You’re rolling your eyes.” “Well  what’s MSNBC?”  Flynn  said. “I mean  come on . . . what’s Al Jazeera?”
By early    Flynn  was enthusiastic about Trump. “He picked the right horse and he picked it early ” the close  Flynn  associate told me.  Flynn ’s Twitter feed  which had once been full of sunset photos and surf reports  turned increasingly reactionary  particularly on immigration and Islam. “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL  ” he posted  last February. Not long afterward  he retweeted a picture apparently showing refugees tromping across the European countryside with text that read  “Historians will look back in amazement that the West destroyed its own civilization.” In July  his book with Ledeen  “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies ” came out. After Trump tweeted an endorsement  the book made the Times best-seller list. Although Ledeen’s name appears (in small type) on the cover  “The Field of Fight” is written in the first person and presented in  Flynn ’s voice. But I ran the book through software that allowed me to compare it to the text of Ledeen’s previous books and articles. Dozens of matches turned up. The similarities suggested just how much Ledeen’s long-standing obsessions had melded into  Flynn ’s. Although an ISIS flag is pictured on the front cover  “The Field of Fight” is  in many ways  a call to action against Iran. “Every day we see evidence of Iranian espionage in the United States ”  Flynn  writes. “It is hard to imagine that there are no Hezbollah terrorist groups inside this country. If they could blow up buildings in Buenos Aires  they can surely do the same here.” During the summer of   the Trump campaign floated  Flynn   a lifelong Democrat  as a Vice-Presidential candidate. After the Republican Convention   Flynn  became a regular presence at Trump campaign events  sometimes accompanied by  his  older son  Michael  Jr. Flynn had been absent for long stretches of Michael  Jr. ’s  teen-age years and early adulthood—he reportedly missed his wedding while deployed in Iraq.  Flynn  made Michael  Jr.   his  chief of staff. In part through his son   Flynn  began flirting with an online community of conspiracy theorists and white nationalists who referred to themselves as the “alt-right.” The neo-Nazis among them called Trump the “God Emperor.” On Twitter   Flynn  frequently tagged Mike Cernovich  an alt-right activist  in tweets  and encouraged others to follow his feed. Michael  Jr.  promoted stories from Alex Jones  the right-wing radio host who believes that the / attacks  and the  school shooting in Sandy Hook  were inside jobs. A little more than a year ago  Michael  Jr.  tweeted @billclinton  “You’re a Rapist.”  Flynn ’s own views seemed to be tilting increasingly toward the fringe. He  as Trump has  publicly insinuated that Obama was a secret Muslim  and not a true American. “I’m not going to sit here and say he’s Islamic ”  Flynn  said of Obama  during remarks last year before the American Congress for Truth  an anti-Muslim group. But Obama “didn’t grow up an American kid ”  Flynn  said  adding that the President’s values were “totally different than mine.”  Flynn  also stoked fear about Muslims and  in a tweet that used the hashtag #NeverHillary  shared an anti-Semitic comment that read  in part  “Not anymore  Jews. Not anymore.” (He subsequently deleted the tweet  calling it “a mistake.”) “I’m not perfect. I’m not a very good social-media person ” he told me in one of our conversations. Stanley McChrystal and Mike Mullen  the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs  both contacted  Flynn  and tried  unsuccessfully  to get him to tone it down.  Flynn  predicted a Trump win  but he was making contingency plans. He began reorienting his firm  the Flynn Intel Group  so that it would be able to compete for lobbying clients after the election. The firm arranged to work with Sphere Consulting  a public-relations and lobbying business in Washington. “Yes  we’re all white  but we’re post-racial white.” In August of last year  a Turkish businessman with close ties to the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hired Flynn Intel Group on a lobbying contract to help promote the view that Turkey’s business climate was a positive one. This was a challenging task  given that Erdoğan had survived a coup attempt just the month before  and was  in retaliation  rounding up anyone considered insufficiently faithful to his regime.  Flynn  had previously been critical of Erdoğan  whom  he  viewed as an Islamist threat.  He  put those concerns aside now as  he  vouched for Erdoğan’s government  writing an op-ed for The Hill that heralded Turkey as “our strongest ally” against ISIS .  Flynn  remembered Election Night fondly  a moment of triumph. “I like to think that I helped get Donald Trump elected President ” he told me. “Maybe I helped a little  maybe a lot.” One of Trump’s first major decisions was to appoint  Flynn  his national-security adviser  calling him “an invaluable asset to me and my Administration.”  Flynn  told me  “Service was something our family was always encouraged to do.”  He  went on  “I made some mistakes  but I’m still serving. It’s like being a priest  you know. I’ve been called to serve.”
After the election   Flynn  spent  his  days at Trump Tower  down the hall from Bannon and Reince Priebus. “My sched is so tight  literally from sunrise to well past sunset ”  Flynn  wrote me  in a text message.  He  was “consumed with reading.” The team  he  assembled drew heavily from  his  former military colleagues  but the qualifications of others were less apparent. K. T. McFarland  until recently a Fox News analyst  became his deputy.  Flynn ’s son  Michael  Jr.  did a brief stint on the transition  before he was dismissed  after continuing to push on Twitter the fake-news story about Hillary Clinton’s role in a child-sex-trafficking ring in a pizzeria in northwest Washington  D.C. Michael Ledeen volunteered to help  Flynn  by examining Obama’s executive orders on foreign policy  particularly on Iran  recommending “which ones should be cancelled  which ones should be expanded  and so on.” Ledeen considered the moment an auspicious one. “I’ve been agitating for thirty years to go after Iran ” he said. “Now all of a sudden we’ve got a national-security adviser  a Secretary of Defense  and the head of the C.I.A. who all agree.” Like Trump   Flynn  stewed over what was said  and written  about  him . Much of it was unfavorable. A scathing Times editorial called his appointment “alarming ” saying that he “would encourage Mr. Trump’s worst impulses.” The editorial went on  “A core theme of Mr. Trump’s campaign was making America safer. With this appointment  he is doing the opposite.” When we met at the restaurant before the Inauguration   Flynn  was guarded. “What’s the purpose of this thing?” he asked me. He had previously questioned whether I would “rehash all this stuff about me being anti-Semitic and pro-Russia and an Islamophobe.”  Flynn  told me  he  prided  himself  as a strategist. I asked about  his  strategy for combatting ISIS .  He  said that Obama had “too narrowly defined” efforts to defeat the enemy. Part of the Trump Administration’s military strategy should include “fighting these guys on the battlefield ”  he  told me.
Although Bannon’s clout seemingly grew by the day   Flynn ’s imprint on national-security policy was unmistakable. Traditionally  the measure of a national-security adviser’s effectiveness has been defined by his relationship with the President. That may well have enabled  Flynn  to hold on to  his  job as long as  he  did; Trump’s loyalty is well known. (When I asked  Flynn  if  he  regarded  himself  as the “honest broker ”  he  said that model was a “misnomer” with Trump. “The honest broker? It’s Donald Trump.”) Nine days into the new Administration  Iran test-fired a ballistic missile from a remote base in the desert.  Flynn  regarded the test as a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution   covering the agreement on Iran’s nuclear program. (In fact  the resolution does not prohibit Iran from firing missiles but  rather  calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.”)  Flynn ’s team drafted a strongly worded warning that criticized the Obama Administration for “fail to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions.” The White House sent a draft to the Pentagon for review. According to a senior military official  staffers in the Defense Secretary’s office recommended softening some of the language and removing the condemnations of the Obama Administration. Their suggestions were ignored. Three days after the missile test  Sean Spicer  the White House press secretary  interrupted his daily briefing and invited  Flynn  to the lectern. The Times had just published a story describing  Flynn ’s influence as waning  and  he  seemed intent on proving otherwise. Trump had encouraged  him  to read the statement  himself    Flynn  later told me. The President “felt a strong message needed to be put out ”  he  said  as if  he  could dispel rumors of White House turmoil by threatening war overseas.  Flynn  scolded Iran for its “destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East” and declared  “As of today  we are officially putting Iran on notice.” I spoke to  Flynn  a few days later. I asked  him  what  he  meant by “on notice.”  He  replied  “We have a standard  set by sanctions that have been put in place  that we expect they will meet.” I asked if  he  thought there were ways to modify Iran’s behavior short of regime change. “You’ll have to ask Khomeini ” he said. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  the cleric who led the Islamic Revolution  died in . Did  Flynn  mean Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  who has led the country since then? “Come on ”  Flynn  said. “That’s my Irish brogue.” He declined to specify how Iran might be punished  because he didn’t want to “telegraph” military action. “One thing I learned as a lieutenant in the Army is that the best plan is the one that gives you the most options at the last possible minute ” he said. Military officials have been drawing up retaliatory options  including warplanes  drones  troops  and cyberattacks. “Planning is trying to keep up with the rhetoric ” one senior defense official told me.","['Two days before the Inauguration of Donald Trump as  the forty-fifth President of the United States  Michael Flynn  a retired lieutenant general and former intelligence officer   sat down in a Washington restaurant. On the tablecloth   he  placed a leather-bound folder and two phones  which flashed with text messages and incoming calls. A gaunt  stern-looking man with hooded eyes and a Roman nose  Flynn is sharp in both manner and language. He had been one of Trump’s earliest supporters  a vociferous booster on television  on Twitter  and  most memorably  from the stage of the Republican National Convention. Strident views and a penchant for conspiracy theories often embroiled him in controversy—in a hacked e-mail from last summer  former Secretary of State Colin Powell called him “right-wing nutty”—but Trump rewarded  Flynn ’s loyalty by making him his national-security adviser. Now  after months of unrelenting scrutiny   Flynn  seemed to believe that  he  could find a measure of obscurity in the West Wing  steps away from Trump and the Oval Office. “I want to go back to having an out-of-sight role ”  he  told me. That ambition proved illusory. Three weeks into  his  job  the Washington Post revealed that  Flynn   while  he  was still a private citizen and Barack Obama was still President  had discussed American sanctions against Russia with Sergey Kislyak  the Russian Ambassador in Washington. The conversations were possibly illegal.  Flynn  and Kislyak’s communications  by phone and text  occurred on the same day the Obama Administration announced the expulsion of thirty-five Russian diplomats in retaliation for Russia’s efforts to swing the election in Trump’s favor.  Flynn  had previously denied talking about sanctions with the Ambassador. At the restaurant   he  said that  he  didn’t think there was anything untoward about the call: “I’ve had a relationship with  him  since my days at the D.I.A.”—the Defense Intelligence Agency  which  Flynn  directed from  to . But  in a classic Washington spectacle of action followed by coverup followed by collapse   Flynn  soon started backpedalling  saying  through a spokesman  that  he  “couldn’t be certain that the topic  never came up.”  He  compounded  his  predicament by making the same denial to Vice-President Mike Pence  who repeated it on television.  Flynn  later apologized to Pence. But by then  his  transgressions had been made public. In a White House characterized by chaos and conflict—a Byzantine court led by a reality-television star  family members  and a circle of ideologues and loyalists— Flynn  was finished. The episode created countless concerns  about the President’s truthfulness  competence  temperament  and associations. How much did Trump know and when did he know it? John McCain  a Republican and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  said that the fiasco was a “troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national-security apparatus” and raised “further questions” about the Trump Administration’s intentions regarding Vladimir Putin’s Russia. In one of several recent conversations  Flynn told me  “We have to figure out how to work with Russia instead of making it an enemy. We have so many problems that we were handed on a plate from this President”—meaning Obama. He lifted a bread plate and waved it. He characterized the negative attention on him as part of a larger conspiracy against Trump. “I’m a target to get at Trump to delegitimize the election ” he said. The press had him “damn near all wrong.” Reporters were just chasing after wild theories  while neglecting to consider his career as a decorated Army officer. “You don’t just sprinkle magic dust on someone  and  poof   they become a three-star general ” he said. But  even before  Flynn ’s rapid fall   his  closest military colleagues had been struggling to make sense of what had happened to the talented and grounded general they once knew. “Mike is inarguably one of the finest leaders the Army has ever produced ” James (Spider) Marks  a retired major general  told me. And yet  watching the first night of the Republican National Convention  last July  Marks was taken aback when his old friend appeared onscreen. “Wake up  America!”  Flynn  said   his  jaw set and  his  hands gripping the sides of the lectern. The United States was in peril: “Our very existence is threatened.” The moment demanded a President with “guts ” he declared  not a “weak  spineless” one who “believes she is above the law.” In the early two-thousands  Marks was  Flynn ’s commanding officer at the Army’s intelligence academy  in Fort Huachuca  Arizona; one of his daughters went to school with one of  Flynn ’s sons. Marks regarded  Flynn  as “smart  humble  and funny.” What he saw on TV was something else: “That’s a vitriolic side of Mike that I never knew.” When  twenty minutes into the speech   Flynn  mentioned Hillary Clinton  the Convention audience responded with chants of “Lock her up!”  Flynn  nodded  leading the chant: “That’s right—lock her up.”  He  went on  “Damn right. . . . And you know why we’re saying that? We’re saying that because  if I  a guy who knows this business  if I did a tenth—a tenth—of what she did  I would be in jail today.” Marks’s thirty-five-year-old daughter  who was watching with him  turned to her father and said  “ Dad  General Flynn is scaring me.”', 'Trump  in his inaugural address  presented a dire image of the country—a nation suffering from poverty and blight  overextended abroad  and neglectful of its own citizens. He pledged to end the “carnage” by putting “America first”—echoing the isolationist creed of the nineteen-thirties. The beginning of Trump’s Presidency remained true to his campaign: even when it came to the highly sensitive issues of national security  Trump and his aides acted with ideological ferocity and a heedless sense of procedure that alarmed many inside the government. The Trump Administration’s early days have invited comparison to the most unnerving political moments in memory  particularly Richard Nixon’s behavior during the Watergate scandal. On January   a week after taking office  Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions and temporarily banning entry to citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. His chief political strategist  Stephen Bannon  reportedly oversaw the crafting of the order  along with Stephen Miller  the White House’s senior policy adviser. (Miller disputes this.)  Flynn  raised some concerns about how the order might affect relationships with allies  but those were ignored. James Mattis  the Secretary of Defense  and General Joseph Dunford  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  received little notice of the order. The next day  Trump signed another executive order  reorganizing the National Security Council. He promoted Bannon  a former investment banker and chairman of the far-right Web site Breitbart News  to a permanent seat on the “principals committee.” Elevating a political adviser to national-security policymaking marked a radical departure from the practice of recent Administrations. “I said  ‘Fetch Chardonnay ’ not ‘Riesling.’ ” By this point  the Justice Department had informed Trump officials of concerns about  Flynn ’s conversations with the Russian Ambassador and his public accounting of them. The acting Attorney General  Sally Yates  a holdover from the Obama Administration  told the White House that she worried  Flynn  might be vulnerable to blackmail by Russian agents  the Washington Post reported. Yet  Flynn  remained an important player in national-security matters. “ He  was always in the room  and on every call ” one Administration official told me. Each morning   Flynn  attended Trump’s intelligence briefing—the President’s Daily Brief. Bannon joined occasionally  as did Mike Pompeo  the director of the C.I.A.  and Reince Priebus  the White House chief of staff.  Flynn  conferred with senior intelligence officials on how to best tailor the briefing for Trump. Presidents are particular about how they receive information  Michael Morell  a former acting C.I.A. director  who prepared and delivered the President’s Daily Brief to several Presidents  told me. George H. W. Bush preferred text on a half page  in a single column  limited to four or five pages; George W. Bush liked his briefs fifteen to twenty pages long  and preferred his briefer to stay in the room while he read the document; Barack Obama studied the material alone  over breakfast. Trump’s briefings were being shaped to address macroeconomics  trade  and “alliances ”  Flynn  told me  in a telephone conversation earlier this month. “The P.D.B. is not always about just your enemies.” Congress created the National Security Council in   in the hope of establishing a more orderly process for coördinating foreign and defense policy. Six years later  Dwight Eisenhower decided that the council needed a chief and named the first national-security adviser—a former soldier and banker  Robert Cutler. The position evolved into one of enormous importance. McGeorge Bundy  who served under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson  regarded himself as a “traffic cop”—controlling access to the President. Under Richard Nixon  Henry Kissinger dramatically expanded the role  often meeting directly with the Soviet Ambassador  and bypassing the State Department. The temptations of power nearly overwhelmed Ronald Reagan’s Presidency  in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair  when national-security staffers were discovered to be running covert actions involving Iran and Central America. The scandal prompted some to call for the national-security adviser to become a Senate-confirmed position. Heading off these demands  George H. W. Bush chose a retired general  Brent Scowcroft  who had held the job under Gerald Ford  to return to the role  confident that Scowcroft would respect the lines between intelligence work  military operations  and policymaking. “He will be an honest broker ” Bush said. Since then  according to Stephen Hadley  George W. Bush’s second-term national-security adviser  the “honest broker” has become the model for Republican and Democratic Administrations alike. That meant overseeing a process that is “fair and transparent  where each member of the council can get his views to the President ” Hadley said. In late November  Hadley met with  Flynn   who was seeking advice  at Trump Tower. Hadley left the meeting optimistic that  Flynn  meant to act as a facilitator in the traditional way. But  Flynn ’s challenge—and now  potentially   his  successor’s—was unique  as Bannon had seemingly moved to set up a kind of “parallel  shadow” national-security staff for  his  own purposes  one council staffer told me. Bannon  who had no direct experience in policymaking  seized a central role on issues dear to Trump. For example  during the campaign Trump had railed against NATO members for not paying their full freight  which unnerved diplomats and politicians throughout Europe. On February   according to the staffer  Bannon sent questions to the N.S.C. staff  requesting a breakdown of contributions to NATO from individual members since . Many of the rank-and-file staffers were alarmed  not just because the questions seemed designed to impugn NATO ’s legitimacy but because they represented a breach of protocol by tasking N.S.C. staffers with political duties. “Those were  Flynn ’s people  not political operatives ” the staffer said.  Flynn  came into the White House wanting to streamline the bureaucracy of the N.S.C.  which is staffed mostly by career civil servants from the State Department  the Pentagon  and intelligence agencies  believing that it moved too ponderously under Obama. But  Flynn   in a contest for power with Bannon  soon seemed to realize that the traditional setup could help him build influence in the White House. “It was dawning on him that the process privileged him ” the N.S.C. staffer said. Others in the White House treated the customary protocols as impediments. “We are moving big and we are moving fast ” Bannon said  according to the Times . Before  Flynn ’s troubles mounted  I asked  him  whether it was appropriate for Bannon to have a permanent seat on the N.S.C.  He  paused. “Well  I mean  that decision’s been made ”  he  said. Besides  didn’t other political advisers enjoy similar access?  He  brought up Valerie Jarrett  a senior adviser to Obama. Jarrett did not have a seat on the National Security Council  I said. “She didn’t? How about  like  Axelrod? He was Clinton  right?” (David Axelrod  who was Obama’s chief strategist  sometimes sat in on N.S.C. meetings but did not participate in policymaking discussions.) Look   Flynn  said  “the President shapes the team that he needs to be able to do the job that he has to do. So that’s kind of where we are on that one.”', ' Flynn  grew up in a large Irish-American household  in Middletown  Rhode Island.  He  was one of nine children.  His  father was a soldier  a veteran of the Second World War and Korea  who retired as a sergeant first class in the Army;  his  mother  a high-school valedictorian  worked at a secretarial school and was heavily involved in Democratic politics  before going back to school to get undergraduate and law degrees. A headstrong teen-ager   Flynn  skateboarded in drained swimming pools and surfed through hurricanes and winter storms. “Mike was a charger ” Sid Abruzzi  a surf-shop owner in nearby Newport  who knew  Flynn  as a teen-ager  said. In   after graduating from the University of Rhode Island   Flynn  joined the Army. He qualified as an intelligence officer  and got orders to join the  Airborne Division  a paratrooper unit in Fort Bragg  North Carolina. In    Flynn  deployed to Grenada  as part of the American invasion force. He set up a listening post on a cliffside to intercept Cuban radio transmissions. One day  spotting two American soldiers being swept out to sea   Flynn  leaped off the cliff—“about a forty-foot jump into the swirling waters ”  he  recalls  in  his  book  “The Field of Fight”—and rescued the men.  He  won a rapid series of promotions. In    he  helped plan operations in support of the American invasion of Haiti. After that   he  rotated to Fort Polk  Louisiana  the site of an Army base for urban-combat and special-operations training. In    he  deployed to Iraq with the Joint Special Operations Command  an élite counterterrorism unit composed of operators from the Delta Force  Rangers  SEAL Team Six  and others. Its culture is unusual in the military: rank is respected but not revered; sergeants challenge colonels  and colonels challenge generals.  Flynn   then a colonel  in charge of the command’s intelligence collection and analysis  had ambitions for expanding the reach of special operations. He considered the command’s operators expert killers—“the best spear fishermen in the world.” But  in order to quell the insurgency spreading in Iraq  they would have to become “net fishermen ” taking down terrorist networks  he said  in a  interview. “I feel like everybody’s podcasting and nobody’s podlistening.”  Flynn  encouraged  his  men to think more like detectives as they hunted Al Qaeda militants; he brought F.B.I. agents in to instruct operators in how to collect and preserve evidence. A former Ranger recalled storming a house  flex-cuffing the tenants  then staying for several hours  risking exposure  while he and his teammates searched behind walls and under mattresses for a single thumb drive—which they found  eventually  in a pipe beneath the kitchen sink. Intelligence operatives would gather information by hacking militants’ computers  intercepting their phone calls  and surveilling them with drones. “We were able to mass so much information against individuals we captured that at some point they realized it was no use lying to us anymore ”  Flynn  says  in “Twilight Warriors: The Soldiers  Spies  and Special Agents Who Are Revolutionizing the American Way of War ” by James Kitfield. On the afternoon of April     American soldiers helicoptered into Yusufiyah  a town outside Baghdad. They raided a suspected Al Qaeda safe house and detained twelve middle-aged men  who were taken to Balad Air Base  the site of the command’s Iraq headquarters  for questioning.  Flynn  observed some of the interviews. Over weeks of interrogation  the prisoners repeatedly denied knowing anything about Al Qaeda or its leader in Iraq  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Finally  two interrogators confronted one of the prisoners about a trip to Amman  Jordan  just before the devastating hotel bombings the previous year. The prisoner started talking  and divulged the identity of Zarqawi’s spiritual adviser and where to find him. Drones tracked the adviser for weeks. One day  the man came out of his house and got into a silver sedan. After two vehicle switches  he pulled into a compound in Hibhib  thirty miles north of Baghdad. A few minutes after the adviser arrived  another man emerged briefly from the house. He matched the description of Zarqawi. As  Flynn  and his boss  General Stanley McChrystal  JSOC ’s commander  watched on a video feed  an F- dropped two bombs on the house. A Delta Force squad quickly arrived at the scene and seized Zarqawi  who died soon afterward. Back at Balad   Flynn  and McChrystal inspected the corpse  laid out on a tarp  confirming that it was Zarqawi.', 'In    Flynn  got a new assignment  at the Pentagon  as the senior intelligence officer reporting to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was an awkward fit.  Flynn   now a major general  was unfamiliar with ordinary Pentagon decorum and sometimes struggled to summon the diplomacy required for the job. Intelligence officers are often irascible figures. “We are trained to be contrarians ” Marks  the retired major general  who was the senior intelligence officer during the invasion of Iraq  said. “I’m the only guy in the room who gets paid to tell you that you’re not as handsome or as smart as you think you are. I’m the one who looks the boss in the eye and says  ‘Your plan is all fucked up.’ ” In November    Obama won the Presidency  having pledged to draw down troops in Iraq and shift military resources back to Afghanistan. He chose McChrystal to lead American forces in Afghanistan. McChrystal asked his friend  Flynn  to become his director of intelligence. Their collaboration in Iraq had severely crippled Al Qaeda. In Afghanistan  though  the terrain was less familiar  and their mission quite different  with a much greater emphasis on winning “hearts and minds.” Still   Flynn  was thrilled to be heading to the battlefield again. According to a friend  when  she  asked  Flynn  whether he’d regret missing an almost certain promotion in Washington  he replied  “Are you kidding me? I get to go back to the shit with Stan.” He landed in Afghanistan in June  . His office was a windowless converted shipping container  and during long days he took briefings and pored over classified assessments.  Flynn  often ate his meals in the chow hall and chatted with subordinates. “I have no recollection of any other general officers doing that ” Toni Gidwani  an intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  in Afghanistan  told me.  Flynn  was intense  but  he  was also funny and “called bullshit when  he  saw it ” according to Vikram Singh  who is now at the Center for American Progress  and at the time was advising Richard Holbrooke  Obama’s chief envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Flynn ’s directives  however  could at times be difficult to follow.  His  talent for absorbing information could race ahead of  his  analytical abilities. “ He  is not a linear thinker ” an intelligence analyst who served on multiple assignments with  Flynn  said. Stephen Biddle  a defense-policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations  recounted late-night meetings in  Flynn ’s container: “His ideas and assessments kept moving around.” Max Boot  a civilian adviser in Afghanistan at the time  told me that  Flynn  got “jerked around by the data”—he would contend that the Taliban were nearly defeated and then  with no less conviction  argue that the militant group was stronger than ever. Part of the challenge was the shortage of reliable intelligence in Afghanistan.  Flynn  considered some of the C.I.A.’s activities counterproductive. When Ahmed Wali Karzai  the brother of President Hamid Karzai and a suspected drug trafficker  was revealed as a longtime C.I.A. asset   Flynn  voiced  his  displeasure with the agency  telling the Times   “If we are going to conduct a population-centric strategy in Afghanistan  and we are perceived as backing thugs  then we are just undermining ourselves.”  Flynn  dispatched a Marine Corps first lieutenant to travel around the country interviewing marines  soldiers  and civilian partners about their intelligence needs. The lieutenant  Matthew Pottinger  had been a Beijing correspondent for the Wall Street Journal before enlisting as an intelligence officer in the Marines. Throughout the autumn of   Pottinger crisscrossed the country. What he heard was dispiriting. An operations officer told him that his knowledge of what was happening in villages was “no more than fingernail deep.” The Americans were ignorant of local power brokers  religious practices  and economics. Pottinger   Flynn   and a senior official from the Defense Intelligence Agency compiled their observations  along with recommendations for changes  into a damning report. In late December  Flynn e-mailed the report to dozens of colleagues at the Pentagon  the White House  and the C.I.A. The response was underwhelming; most didn’t even bother to reply. Pottinger suggested finding a publisher outside the government  and  Flynn  agreed. On January     the Center for a New American Security  a progressive think tank  released “Fixing Intel: A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan.” Reviews outside the military were laudatory  but senior Pentagon and C.I.A. officials were angered by  Flynn ’s decision to go public. “I was very concerned about an intelligence officer openly criticizing our intelligence community ” former C.I.A. director Leon Panetta told me.  Flynn  and Pottinger understood that they might be fired. Defense Secretary Robert Gates delivered a judgment of the report that saved them. He called it “exactly the type of candid  critical self-assessment” that the military needed. “Fixing Intel” consolidated  Flynn ’s exalted status in the intelligence community. In   Defense News ranked him seventeenth on its “ Most Influential” list  heralding the report as something that “might have ended his career” but which  instead  “accelerated it.”', 'Three months after “Fixing Intel” was published  McChrystal and some members of his staff flew to Paris to strengthen support for the war among French officials.  Flynn  stayed behind in Afghanistan. A Rolling Stone reporter who had been spending time with McChrystal joined him on the trip and heard him and his staff speaking derisively about the political leadership in Washington  and witnessed them getting drunk one night at an Irish pub. In mid-June    the magazine piece  “The Runaway General ” appeared. McChrystal was quoted calling Vice-President Joe Biden “shortsighted” for his opposition to the surge in Afghanistan; one aide mocked Biden as “Bite Me”; and another aide dismissed Jim Jones  Obama’s first national-security adviser  as a “clown.” Obama fired McChrystal the day after publication.  Flynn  chafed at the decision. “It’s hard to see someone you know have to go through that ” a close associate of  Flynn ’s told me. “You don’t heal from that overnight.”  Flynn  prepared to leave Afghanistan  as McChrystal’s successor  David Petraeus  brought in his own staff. Before  Flynn  departed   he  stopped by the Joint Intelligence Operations Center to say goodbye. Speaking to dozens of analysts   Flynn  delivered a forty-five-minute lesson  covering some of the bloodiest engagements in American history: the Battle of Antietam  in   when twenty-three thousand people were killed or wounded in a single day; Operation Torch  in   when several hundred soldiers died establishing beachheads in North Africa as part of the Allied invasion. “His point was that no one in Washington can ever appreciate what is happening on the battlefield  and that there aren’t as many Americans dying now as before ” the intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  said. “But it was confusing  and these would be the same kind of discussions you’d have with him about the nature of the insurgency—you’d leave his office and spend an hour trying to figure out what he was trying to say.” Back in Washington   Flynn  was assigned to the office of James Clapper  the director of national intelligence.  Flynn ’s success in Iraq and Afghanistan made  him  popular in foreign-policy circles. In April     he  attended a luncheon at the Army and Navy Club  a members-only hotel and restaurant two blocks from the White House. About two dozen guests sat in a private room  around a long table. Iran was a major focus of the conversation  according to one of the event’s hosts  Mary Beth Long  a former C.I.A. case officer and a senior Pentagon official during the George W. Bush Administration. The attendees included a neoconservative historian named Michael Ledeen  who was then a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute  a Washington think tank. Ledeen had been obsessed with Iran for decades. In the mid-eighties  as a consultant to Reagan’s National Security Council  he played a central role in the Iran-Contra affair—introducing Oliver North  Reagan’s counterterrorism adviser  to Manucher Ghorbanifar  an Iranian arms dealer. Ledeen’s hope had been to stir up dissent inside Iran through Ghorbanifar’s network of influential contacts  according to the Presidential commission that investigated the affair. (Ledeen disputes this.) Instead  Ghorbanifar wound up as the middleman in the sale of weapons to Iran  in exchange for Tehran’s assistance in freeing American hostages held by Iranian-backed Islamists in Lebanon. But Ledeen’s zeal for regime change in Iran remained undiminished. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq  he called for American forces to press on  into Iran. “As Ronald Reagan once said  ‘America is too great a country to settle for small dreams ’ ” he wrote  in . Iraq was a distraction; Iran was “the real war.”  Flynn   too  increasingly viewed Iran as a great menace. In Iraq  he had seen scores of young Americans killed by sophisticated armor-piercing explosives  supplied to Shiite militias by the Quds Force  an élite unit of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Flynn  and Ledeen became close friends; in their shared view of the world  Ledeen supplied an intellectual and historical perspective   Flynn  a tactical one. “I’ve spent my professional life studying evil ” Ledeen told me.  Flynn  said  in a recent speech  “I’ve sat down with really  really evil people”—he cited Al Qaeda  the Taliban  Russians  Chinese generals—“and all I want to do is punch the guy in the nose.” A month after the luncheon  a team of Navy SEAL s raided a compound in Abbotabad  Pakistan  and killed Osama bin Laden.  Flynn  was critical of the limitations placed on intelligence work after the raid. Analysts had spent several weeks going through the hard drives and phones seized in the raid looking for “targeting data”—clues on the whereabouts of other terrorists—and leads on imminent threats. But  Flynn  and others advocated going deeper  with the hope of learning more about Al Qaeda’s finances and backers and organizational structure. A team returned to the materials and uncovered documents that seemed to point to a closer relationship between Al Qaeda and Iran than was previously understood. In one memorandum  a lieutenant asks bin Laden for permission to send an associate planning attacks in Europe into Iran for “around three months” to “train the brothers.”  Flynn  saw such references as evidence of Iran’s duplicity  in supporting Shiite and Sunni extremists alike. It seemed validation of Ledeen’s views on Iran. (Others in the intelligence community  including Panetta  the C.I.A. director at the time of the raid  were dubious about a close relationship between Al Qaeda and Iran.) James Mattis  the Marine general in charge of U.S. Central Command  whose responsibilities included the Middle East and Central Asia  had been pushing for more aggressive action against Iran. In the summer of   Mattis  who is now the Secretary of Defense  wanted to launch a rocket assault on an Iranian power plant in retaliation for the killing of six American soldiers by Iranian rockets in Baghdad. But the Obama Administration was hoping to get out of the Middle East  not risk starting another war there.  Flynn  felt that the Administration was being naïve  and that no one seemed to care about what  he  insisted was the collusion between Al Qaeda and Iran. “ He  was incensed ” an analyst who worked with  Flynn  at the time said. “ He  saw this as truth suppression.”', 'In April    Obama nominated  Flynn  to be the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Within the intelligence community  the agency was considered a backwater. “It’s the bastard child ” Mary Beth Long  the former C.I.A. officer  said. The agency  whose headquarters are in southwest Washington  produced reports on topics like Middle Eastern weapons deals  changes of command in China  and troop movements on the Korean peninsula—essential work for assessing foreign military capabilities but hardly exciting. To invigorate the D.I.A.   Flynn  wanted to break down the barriers between collectors and analysts; enhance the stable of clandestine case officers who operated overseas  like their C.I.A. counterparts; and reorganize the agency on the basis of geography. The goal was to transform the D.I.A. into a more agile organization.  Flynn ’s ideas were informed by  his  experience in helping to overhaul JSOC . But it was unclear whether they would work at the D.I.A.  with seventeen thousand employees. “ JSOC has a small  tight-knit group of folks making real-time tactical decisions that must be executed tonight  ” a senior military intelligence official told me. “A big organization like the D.I.A. just can’t respond that quickly.” Peter Shelby  a retired marine and former D.I.A. official  told me he assumed that  Flynn  would be methodical in his approach: spend a few months at headquarters; learn how the organization worked; cultivate respected agency veterans; and then introduce changes. Instead  Shelby said  “ Flynn  came in and threw a bomb to explode the whole place  and then just let the dust settle.” Employees started to complain. Many sought reassignment with other agencies. “Morale was in the toilet ” Shelby said. “To higher-level observers   Flynn  looked like this bold leader  willing to make changes in the face of opposition. But  the further down you went  the more negative impact there was  because it was complete chaos.” “I said  ‘I wonder what it means ’ not ‘Tell me what it means.’ ” Moreover   Flynn  could be sloppy with numbers and details—misstatements that  his  staffers derided as “ Flynn  facts.”  His  habit of chasing hunches also exasperated some staff members. In September    after the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate and annex in Benghazi   Flynn  urged an investigation into an Iran connection;  his  insistence that Iran was involved “stunned” subordinates  according to the Times . ( Flynn  denies that  he  asked for a probe.) An intelligence analyst who worked with  Flynn  during this period told me that his iconoclasm sometimes went too far. “By nature   Flynn  takes a contrarian approach to even the most simple analytic issues ” the analyst said. “After Benghazi  I remember him using the phrase ‘black swan’ a lot. What’s a ‘black swan’? He was looking for the random event that nobody could predict. Look  you certainly have to keep your eye on the ball for that  but there’s a reason why it’s a black swan . You shouldn’t dedicate a ton of time to that.” In    Flynn  arranged a trip to Moscow to speak to a group of officers from the G.R.U.  Russia’s intelligence agency  about leadership development. His decision to go was a controversial one.  Flynn  believed that there were opportunities to find common ground with Russia. But Steven Hall  the C.I.A.’s chief of Russia operations at the time  was skeptical. “He wanted to build a relationship with his counterparts in the G.R.U.  which seemed  at best  quaint and naïve ” Hall told me. “Every time we have tried to have some sort of meaningful coöperation with the Russians  it’s almost always been manipulated and turned back against us.” Several months after  Flynn  returned from  his  Moscow trip   he  hoped to reciprocate by inviting several senior G.R.U. officers to the United States. Clapper  the director of national intelligence  cautioned  him  against it. Russia had recently annexed Crimea  and Russian special-forces operatives were fomenting a violent clash between rebels and Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine. By then   Flynn  had become a target of scorn for many inside the department. His deputy  David Shedd  became one of his harshest critics  and did little to hide his disdain. “I was walking by the front office once and heard David Shedd say  ‘I’m going to save the agency from the director ’ ” Simone Ledeen  who works in counter-threat finance at a multinational bank  said. Ledeen had worked for  Flynn  in Afghanistan  at the office for the director of national intelligence  and in the D.I.A.  doing threat-assessment research. (She is also Michael Ledeen’s daughter.) Normally  a D.I.A. director serves for three or more years  but  in late   Clapper and Michael Vickers  the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence  were concerned about the tumult inside the agency and told  Flynn  that  his  tenure would last just two years.  Flynn  unsuccessfully tried to extend  his  term when  his  successor’s nomination was delayed. Shedd later became the acting director. On August     at a ceremony in the atrium of the D.I.A.’s headquarters   Flynn  retired from the military  after thirty-three years. His wife and two sons attended  as did Michael Ledeen. The senior military intelligence official  who was present  told me that  Flynn  was obviously bitter: “He was loading up  and he was not going to go quietly.”', ' Flynn   who was fifty-five  began fashioning a post-military life. He started his own business  the Flynn Intel Group  which offered clients a range of private intelligence and security services. He did some freelance consulting and also worked with SBD Advisors  a strategic consulting firm whose roster included the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen; former chief of the Special Operations Command Admiral Eric Olson; and other retired military officers. In January     Flynn  signed with Leading Authorities  a speakers’ bureau  which promoted  his  expertise in leadership  cybersecurity  and terrorism.  Flynn  began developing a public profile as a decorated former general with experience in fighting Islamic extremism. A month later   he  made an appearance on “Charlie Rose.”  He  spoke at length about the threat posed by the Islamic State  which had been executing hostages and rapidly acquiring territory in northern Iraq and Syria. But America faced bigger foes than isis    he  said. “Iran has killed more Americans than Al Qaeda has through state sponsors  through its terrorist network  called Hezbollah.” This was a puzzling assertion. “Hezbollah has killed more Americans than Al Qaeda?” Rose asked.  Flynn  began a count  starting with Hezbollah’s  bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that killed two hundred and eighty-three people.  He  cited other instances  but  his  math made little sense  and the numbers fell far short of the nearly three thousand killed by Al Qaeda’s attacks on /. Rose moved on  but a friend who had accompanied  Flynn  to the studio pulled  him  aside after the taping and questioned  his  Iran claim. One of Rose’s producers offered to fact-check the segment  but  he  waved off the suggestion. Another friend who’d come to the taping suggested contacting an expert from the intelligence community. That wouldn’t be necessary   Flynn  said— he  would just call Michael Ledeen.  Flynn  and Ledeen’s relationship soon became a professional collaboration.  Flynn  asked Ledeen to help  him  write a book.  Flynn  wanted to position  himself  as a sage counsellor for the upcoming Presidential campaign. Ledeen had written more than a dozen books  including five on Iran. They were often polemical works  with titles such as “The War Against the Terror Masters” and “The Iranian Time Bomb ” and were filled with sweeping statements like “Islamic fundamentalism  of which the ideology of the Iranian regime is a textbook case  draws much of its inspiration from Mussolini  Hitler  and Stalin.” In April     Flynn  accepted an invitation to spend a week at Dartmouth. Daniel Benjamin  a former State Department counterterrorism chief who now directed the school’s international-affairs center  had come to know  Flynn  in Afghanistan. He considered him friendly and engaging  and thought students and faculty would appreciate his insights and his unconventionality. He set up class visits  dinner discussions  and a talk  which  Flynn  titled “World Without Order.” Benjamin told me that he quickly realized during the visit that  Flynn ’s “easygoing pragmatism” had given way to some “very hard-edged ideas ” particularly on Iran.  Flynn  voiced contempt toward Iran’s leaders (“They are liars”) and said that they had “no right” to participate in negotiations with the United States over their nuclear program. (The Iran nuclear deal was signed in July  .) “I’ve encountered plenty of military officers who were deeply upset by the role that Iranian-backed militias played in Iraq  but  Flynn ’s animosity was off the charts ” Benjamin said.  Flynn  expressed similarly harsh views of Islam in general  describing the faith as a political ideology  and not a religion. Benjamin  who  in   co-wrote a book  “The Age of Sacred Terror ” about the ideological war that America faced against radical Islam  deemed  Flynn ’s comments “pointlessly pejorative” and thought they would serve only to inflame extremists. He began discouraging Dartmouth’s administrators and faculty from attending the events. On Fox News  NBC’s “Meet the Press ” CNN  and elsewhere   Flynn  became increasingly critical of the Obama Administration. He lashed out at the Iran nuclear deal  the Administration’s ISIS strategy  and its approach to radical Islam generally. Several Republican hopefuls preparing to run against Hillary Clinton asked for his advice. Carly Fiorina  the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive  brought  Flynn  on as an informal adviser for her Presidential bid. She told me that she found him refreshing. “He is a very down-to-earth  approachable guy ” she said. She was also impressed by his candor.  Flynn   she said  “doesn’t pull punches.” In August     Flynn  went to New York to meet Trump for the first time. They were scheduled to talk for thirty minutes; the conversation lasted ninety.  Flynn  was deeply impressed. “I knew  he  was going to be the President of the United States ”  he  told me. “Look  until there’s a Tinder for pandas  we have to meet the old-fashioned way: being locked in a room together by scientists.” Two months later   Flynn  appeared on RT  the English-language Russian television channel  formerly known as Russia Today. The outlet was widely regarded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin  even before a recent U.S. intelligence report on Russian hacking and the Presidential election said that the channel had become an important part of a “Kremlin-directed campaign to undermine faith in the US Government.”  Flynn  discussed the civil war in Syria  where Russian jets were flying bombing sorties in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.  He  contrasted Putin’s resolve with what  he  described as Obama’s dithering in the region: “There’s no coherence or no clarity to the strategy.”', 'In early November    a D.C.-based representative of RT contacted  Flynn ’s speakers’ bureau and invited him to Moscow for the channel’s tenth-anniversary celebration. The fee was approximately forty thousand dollars  according to a source familiar with the arrangement. This trip was considerably more fraught than the one he had made as D.I.A. director. On December   RT issued a press release announcing  Flynn ’s participation. In e-mails  Simone Ledeen urged her former boss  and family friend  to reconsider. “I begged him  ‘Please  sir: don’t do this. It’s not just you. You’re a retired three-star general. It’s the Army. It’s all of the people who have been with you  all of these analysts known as “ Flynn ’s people.” Don’t do this to them. Don’t do this to yourself.’ ”  Flynn  assured  his  critics that  he  knew what  he  was doing. “Know my values and beliefs are mine & won’t change because I’m on a different piece of geography ”  he  tweeted. Before the trip   Flynn  received a classified counterespionage briefing at D.I.A. headquarters. Hall  the former C.I.A. chief of Russia operations  told me  “Whatever personal electronic device you carry with you into Russia will be compromised.”  Flynn  stayed at a hotel near Red Square. The RT gala featured speakers and panel discussions during the day and a dinner at night. That morning  Sophie Shevardnadze  an RT correspondent  interviewed  Flynn . From the stage  he confessed to feeling as if he were behind enemy lines. “I’m sort of in the lair ” he said. A Russian jet had recently been shot down near the Syrian border by a Turkish plane  and Shevardnadze asked  Flynn  how Russia should respond. “Are we not to react? What does Turkey expect?”  she  asked.  Circumspect  Flynn  said  “I don’t know what Turkey expects. I don’t know what Russia expects.”  Flynn  also seemed to go out of  his  way to tweak the Russian government and its partners in Damascus and Tehran. “Let’s face it  come on  is Assad the future of Syria  given the way the situation has unfolded?”  Flynn  said.  He  added that Assad’s allies in Iran were making things worse in Syria and elsewhere. “Iran exports a lot of terrorism ” he declared.  Flynn  was seated at the head table for dinner that evening. Putin sat to his left. Cyril Svoboda  the former foreign minister of the Czech Republic  sat to  Flynn ’s right. I called Svoboda  who speaks fluent English and Russian  and who translated a brief exchange between the two men  and asked what they discussed. “It was very  very short ” Svoboda said. “ ‘ Kak vashi dela ?’ ‘ Shto novovo ?’ ‘ Khorosho .’ ” (“How are you?” “What’s new?” “Good.”) After dinner  Putin went onstage and congratulated RT on its success. The Russian government wasn’t perfect  he said  so he appreciated RT for its presentation of “various points of view.” After Putin concluded his remarks   Flynn   joining other diners  stood and applauded. Last year   Flynn  talked to Dana Priest  of the Washington Post  about the trip. When Priest asked why he would go on RT  a state-run channel   Flynn  replied  “Well  what’s CNN?” “Well  it’s not run by the state ” Priest said. “You’re rolling your eyes.” “Well  what’s MSNBC?”  Flynn  said. “I mean  come on . . . what’s Al Jazeera?”', 'By early    Flynn  was enthusiastic about Trump. “He picked the right horse and he picked it early ” the close  Flynn  associate told me.  Flynn ’s Twitter feed  which had once been full of sunset photos and surf reports  turned increasingly reactionary  particularly on immigration and Islam. “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL  ” he posted  last February. Not long afterward  he retweeted a picture apparently showing refugees tromping across the European countryside with text that read  “Historians will look back in amazement that the West destroyed its own civilization.” In July  his book with Ledeen  “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies ” came out. After Trump tweeted an endorsement  the book made the Times best-seller list. Although Ledeen’s name appears (in small type) on the cover  “The Field of Fight” is written in the first person and presented in  Flynn ’s voice. But I ran the book through software that allowed me to compare it to the text of Ledeen’s previous books and articles. Dozens of matches turned up. The similarities suggested just how much Ledeen’s long-standing obsessions had melded into  Flynn ’s. Although an ISIS flag is pictured on the front cover  “The Field of Fight” is  in many ways  a call to action against Iran. “Every day we see evidence of Iranian espionage in the United States ”  Flynn  writes. “It is hard to imagine that there are no Hezbollah terrorist groups inside this country. If they could blow up buildings in Buenos Aires  they can surely do the same here.” During the summer of   the Trump campaign floated  Flynn   a lifelong Democrat  as a Vice-Presidential candidate. After the Republican Convention   Flynn  became a regular presence at Trump campaign events  sometimes accompanied by  his  older son  Michael  Jr. Flynn had been absent for long stretches of Michael  Jr. ’s  teen-age years and early adulthood—he reportedly missed his wedding while deployed in Iraq.  Flynn  made Michael  Jr.   his  chief of staff. In part through his son   Flynn  began flirting with an online community of conspiracy theorists and white nationalists who referred to themselves as the “alt-right.” The neo-Nazis among them called Trump the “God Emperor.” On Twitter   Flynn  frequently tagged Mike Cernovich  an alt-right activist  in tweets  and encouraged others to follow his feed. Michael  Jr.  promoted stories from Alex Jones  the right-wing radio host who believes that the / attacks  and the  school shooting in Sandy Hook  were inside jobs. A little more than a year ago  Michael  Jr.  tweeted @billclinton  “You’re a Rapist.”  Flynn ’s own views seemed to be tilting increasingly toward the fringe. He  as Trump has  publicly insinuated that Obama was a secret Muslim  and not a true American. “I’m not going to sit here and say he’s Islamic ”  Flynn  said of Obama  during remarks last year before the American Congress for Truth  an anti-Muslim group. But Obama “didn’t grow up an American kid ”  Flynn  said  adding that the President’s values were “totally different than mine.”  Flynn  also stoked fear about Muslims and  in a tweet that used the hashtag #NeverHillary  shared an anti-Semitic comment that read  in part  “Not anymore  Jews. Not anymore.” (He subsequently deleted the tweet  calling it “a mistake.”) “I’m not perfect. I’m not a very good social-media person ” he told me in one of our conversations. Stanley McChrystal and Mike Mullen  the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs  both contacted  Flynn  and tried  unsuccessfully  to get him to tone it down.  Flynn  predicted a Trump win  but he was making contingency plans. He began reorienting his firm  the Flynn Intel Group  so that it would be able to compete for lobbying clients after the election. The firm arranged to work with Sphere Consulting  a public-relations and lobbying business in Washington. “Yes  we’re all white  but we’re post-racial white.” In August of last year  a Turkish businessman with close ties to the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hired Flynn Intel Group on a lobbying contract to help promote the view that Turkey’s business climate was a positive one. This was a challenging task  given that Erdoğan had survived a coup attempt just the month before  and was  in retaliation  rounding up anyone considered insufficiently faithful to his regime.  Flynn  had previously been critical of Erdoğan  whom  he  viewed as an Islamist threat.  He  put those concerns aside now as  he  vouched for Erdoğan’s government  writing an op-ed for The Hill that heralded Turkey as “our strongest ally” against ISIS .  Flynn  remembered Election Night fondly  a moment of triumph. “I like to think that I helped get Donald Trump elected President ” he told me. “Maybe I helped a little  maybe a lot.” One of Trump’s first major decisions was to appoint  Flynn  his national-security adviser  calling him “an invaluable asset to me and my Administration.”  Flynn  told me  “Service was something our family was always encouraged to do.”  He  went on  “I made some mistakes  but I’m still serving. It’s like being a priest  you know. I’ve been called to serve.”', 'After the election   Flynn  spent  his  days at Trump Tower  down the hall from Bannon and Reince Priebus. “My sched is so tight  literally from sunrise to well past sunset ”  Flynn  wrote me  in a text message.  He  was “consumed with reading.” The team  he  assembled drew heavily from  his  former military colleagues  but the qualifications of others were less apparent. K. T. McFarland  until recently a Fox News analyst  became his deputy.  Flynn ’s son  Michael  Jr.  did a brief stint on the transition  before he was dismissed  after continuing to push on Twitter the fake-news story about Hillary Clinton’s role in a child-sex-trafficking ring in a pizzeria in northwest Washington  D.C. Michael Ledeen volunteered to help  Flynn  by examining Obama’s executive orders on foreign policy  particularly on Iran  recommending “which ones should be cancelled  which ones should be expanded  and so on.” Ledeen considered the moment an auspicious one. “I’ve been agitating for thirty years to go after Iran ” he said. “Now all of a sudden we’ve got a national-security adviser  a Secretary of Defense  and the head of the C.I.A. who all agree.” Like Trump   Flynn  stewed over what was said  and written  about  him . Much of it was unfavorable. A scathing Times editorial called his appointment “alarming ” saying that he “would encourage Mr. Trump’s worst impulses.” The editorial went on  “A core theme of Mr. Trump’s campaign was making America safer. With this appointment  he is doing the opposite.” When we met at the restaurant before the Inauguration   Flynn  was guarded. “What’s the purpose of this thing?” he asked me. He had previously questioned whether I would “rehash all this stuff about me being anti-Semitic and pro-Russia and an Islamophobe.”  Flynn  told me  he  prided  himself  as a strategist. I asked about  his  strategy for combatting ISIS .  He  said that Obama had “too narrowly defined” efforts to defeat the enemy. Part of the Trump Administration’s military strategy should include “fighting these guys on the battlefield ”  he  told me.', 'Although Bannon’s clout seemingly grew by the day   Flynn ’s imprint on national-security policy was unmistakable. Traditionally  the measure of a national-security adviser’s effectiveness has been defined by his relationship with the President. That may well have enabled  Flynn  to hold on to  his  job as long as  he  did; Trump’s loyalty is well known. (When I asked  Flynn  if  he  regarded  himself  as the “honest broker ”  he  said that model was a “misnomer” with Trump. “The honest broker? It’s Donald Trump.”) Nine days into the new Administration  Iran test-fired a ballistic missile from a remote base in the desert.  Flynn  regarded the test as a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution   covering the agreement on Iran’s nuclear program. (In fact  the resolution does not prohibit Iran from firing missiles but  rather  calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.”)  Flynn ’s team drafted a strongly worded warning that criticized the Obama Administration for “fail to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions.” The White House sent a draft to the Pentagon for review. According to a senior military official  staffers in the Defense Secretary’s office recommended softening some of the language and removing the condemnations of the Obama Administration. Their suggestions were ignored. Three days after the missile test  Sean Spicer  the White House press secretary  interrupted his daily briefing and invited  Flynn  to the lectern. The Times had just published a story describing  Flynn ’s influence as waning  and  he  seemed intent on proving otherwise. Trump had encouraged  him  to read the statement  himself    Flynn  later told me. The President “felt a strong message needed to be put out ”  he  said  as if  he  could dispel rumors of White House turmoil by threatening war overseas.  Flynn  scolded Iran for its “destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East” and declared  “As of today  we are officially putting Iran on notice.” I spoke to  Flynn  a few days later. I asked  him  what  he  meant by “on notice.”  He  replied  “We have a standard  set by sanctions that have been put in place  that we expect they will meet.” I asked if  he  thought there were ways to modify Iran’s behavior short of regime change. “You’ll have to ask Khomeini ” he said. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  the cleric who led the Islamic Revolution  died in . Did  Flynn  mean Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  who has led the country since then? “Come on ”  Flynn  said. “That’s my Irish brogue.” He declined to specify how Iran might be punished  because he didn’t want to “telegraph” military action. “One thing I learned as a lieutenant in the Army is that the best plan is the one that gives you the most options at the last possible minute ” he said. Military officials have been drawing up retaliatory options  including warplanes  drones  troops  and cyberattacks. “Planning is trying to keep up with the rhetoric ” one senior defense official told me.']","['Two days before the Inauguration of Donald Trump as  the forty-fifth President of the United States  Michael Flynn  a retired lieutenant general and former intelligence officer   sat down in a Washington restaurant', 'On the tablecloth   he  placed a leather-bound folder and two phones  which flashed with text messages and incoming calls', 'A gaunt  stern-looking man with hooded eyes and a Roman nose  Flynn is sharp in both manner and language', 'He had been one of Trump’s earliest supporters  a vociferous booster on television  on Twitter  and  most memorably  from the stage of the Republican National Convention', 'Strident views and a penchant for conspiracy theories often embroiled him in controversy—in a hacked e-mail from last summer  former Secretary of State Colin Powell called him “right-wing nutty”—but Trump rewarded  Flynn ’s loyalty by making him his national-security adviser', 'Now  after months of unrelenting scrutiny   Flynn  seemed to believe that  he  could find a measure of obscurity in the West Wing  steps away from Trump and the Oval Office', '“I want to go back to having an out-of-sight role ”  he  told me', 'That ambition proved illusory', 'Three weeks into  his  job  the Washington Post revealed that  Flynn   while  he  was still a private citizen and Barack Obama was still President  had discussed American sanctions against Russia with Sergey Kislyak  the Russian Ambassador in Washington', 'The conversations were possibly illegal', 'Flynn  and Kislyak’s communications  by phone and text  occurred on the same day the Obama Administration announced the expulsion of thirty-five Russian diplomats in retaliation for Russia’s efforts to swing the election in Trump’s favor', 'Flynn  had previously denied talking about sanctions with the Ambassador', 'At the restaurant   he  said that  he  didn’t think there was anything untoward about the call: “I’ve had a relationship with  him  since my days at the D', '”—the Defense Intelligence Agency  which  Flynn  directed from  to', 'But  in a classic Washington spectacle of action followed by coverup followed by collapse   Flynn  soon started backpedalling  saying  through a spokesman  that  he  “couldn’t be certain that the topic  never came up', '”  He  compounded  his  predicament by making the same denial to Vice-President Mike Pence  who repeated it on television', 'Flynn  later apologized to Pence', 'But by then  his  transgressions had been made public', 'In a White House characterized by chaos and conflict—a Byzantine court led by a reality-television star  family members  and a circle of ideologues and loyalists— Flynn  was finished', 'The episode created countless concerns  about the President’s truthfulness  competence  temperament  and associations', 'How much did Trump know and when did he know it?

4187,test,"Before search parties began looking for a missing -year-old girl in Texas this month  and before her father changed his story about how she went missing  Sherin Mathews was a happy  cheerful child at an orphanage in India.
“We loved her laughter ” Babita Kumari  who managed the Mother Teresa Orphanage and Children’s Home in the city of Nalanda in eastern India’s Bihar state  told the Associated Press on Thursday.  Sherin  had lived at the orphanage since  she  was an infant and at the time was named Saraswati  after the Hindu goddess of wisdom.
“ She  was a smart child ” Kumari said.
 Mathews  had reported  his  daughter missing Oct.  after  he  said  he  sent her alone into an alley near their Richardson  Tex.  home as punishment for refusing to drink her milk. It was a narrative that transfixed the Dallas community and those in India with its unanswered questions — such as why  Mathews  waited several hours to report  her  disappearance  or why there were few clues as to where  she  might have gone.
Then  more than two weeks later and not long after authorities said they had “most likely” found the girl’s body  police said  Mathews  “voluntarily arrived at the Richardson Police Station with  his  attorney and asked to speak with detectives.” This time   he  told police that  he  had been “trying to get the -year-old girl to drink her milk in the garage” but she wouldn't listen to  him   according to  his  arrest affidavit.
At that point   Mathews  said  he  “physically assisted” Sherin in drinking her milk and that the girl choked on the drink.
 Mathews  told police  his  daughter had developmental disabilities and a special diet regimen in which she had to eat whenever she was awake to gain weight.

 Sherin  was sent to the orphanage in Nalanda by child welfare authorities when  she  was just a few months old. The orphanage has since been shut down  Kumari said  because of missing paperwork. The orphanage plans to challenge the shutdown  she said.
Kumari said the Mathewses didn't raise any red flags at the orphanage when they adopted  Sherin . After their first visit with the girl  they called frequently from the United States  wanting to hear her voice. They seemed to love her  Kumari said.

The trio all have interesting questions to answer heading into the evaluation process that includes the NFL Scouting Combine  Pro Days and visits with teams. Rosen is the most Day  ready in the eyes of most evaluators.  Darnold  has intangibles that makes NFL teams salivate. Allen has the best physical traits of the three.
“Allen has the most physical ability but is the furthest away in terms of consistency and just technique and decision-making right now ” McShay said. “ Darnold  has performed the best in big situations.  He  creates and just makes plays happen.  He  just has that ‘it’ factor more than the other two.  Rosen  has what you look for in an NFL quarterback in terms of in-the-pocket  progression reads  fast eyes  making throws  anticipating  accuracy.  He  is the most technically sound  refined quarterback of the three.”
 Darnold  and  Rosen  are clearly viewed as the top two quarterbacks right now  with some distance from Allen. Evaluators seem split on which one is better right now.
“Everybody wants it to be  Rosen  or  Darnold  ” said Dilfer  a -year NFL veteran who has studied all of the quarterbacks this season. “I think it’s both. They’re both good prospects. It comes down to which flavor of ice cream do you like best. Personally  I like mint chip and my wife likes rocky road. It doesn’t mean one of us is right and one of us is wrong. They’re both great. That’s how you look at these prospects. I don’t think you can go wrong with either. It comes down to which flavor you like.”
 Darnold  entered the season with more hype.  He  finished the year with  touchdowns   interceptions and nine fumbles. Some of  his  struggles can be attributed to the team around  him .  His  offensive line had a rash of injuries and  he  was working with young wide receivers.

4196,test,"That IP address was owned by Greenfloid LLC  a company registered to New Yorker Sergey Kashyrin and two others. Other Russian propaganda sites  like BlackMattersUs.com  were also hosted on servers with IP addresses owned by Greenfloid. The company’s ties to Russian propaganda sites were first reported by ThinkProgress.
Quiet Neighborhood  Nasty Material 
Sergey Kashyrin  now lives in a quiet Staten Island neighborhood of bungalows  semi-detached homes  and cracked sidewalks just a few blocks from Midland beach. It is still reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. When a reporter visited Monday morning   Kashyrin ’s street was blocked off by road work signs and mud-caked tire tracks traced the roads. On nearly every block  construction crews were still at work repairing boarded up homes amid tall marsh grasses towering in overgrown yards.
In business filings   Kashyrin  and the two other registrants of Greenfloid LLC all gave their address as a well-kept beige semi-detached house in the middle of a quiet block. It has a lush and green backyard  with a greenhouse and coop  and tall plants that peek out of the front-facing windows. The house  if not the block  seems to have avoided much of the devastation; across the street are wild lots where other homes once stood.  Kashyrin  wasn’t home  and a woman suggested a reporter call him.
Reached by phone   Kashyrin  gave a string of answers  many of them contradictory. He initially said he didn’t want to talk about Greenfloid LLC. Then he said he was available to talk  and said that Greenfloid is part of the fight against Russian propaganda—nevermind the fact that his company hosted it.
 Kashyrin  next pivoted to say  his  service didn’t consciously provide hosting to the Russian trolls—despite evidence to the contrary—but instead unknowingly rented them virtual servers that they used to funnel traffic to a different hosting company in Russia.  He  declined to name the company. “We were not hosting those websites. The guys bought virtual servers  and they put the proxy ”  Kashyrin  said. “ It  just redirected to the original site in Russia.”
Such an arrangement would have the same effect as hosting  while slowing the troll websites and consuming needless bandwidth. But  it ’s conceivable the Russians used such a scheme to make it easier to quickly relocate the sites without having to copy their contents. It’s largely a distinction without a difference— Kashyrin ’s firm was still serving the Russian propaganda through  its  servers and internet  even if the images and text were ultimately held in Russia as  Kashyrin  claims.
When asked why the company hosts so many fake news sites  often angled toward Russian interests   Kashyrin  said that there are likely simply many customers “from there who are doing that.”
ITL was alerted and the site was taken offline  Fontanka reported. ( Kashyrin  said it was around the same time that Greenfloid banned proxies  disassociating itself from the two Russian sites.  He  declined to provide a link to the proxy ban policy because “it’s too late today.”) ITL also took down a separate news site  registered at the same time as WhoisWhos  that reported on the Russian-backed war in Ukraine from a pro-Russian perspective. Fontanka said its investigation strongly suggested the sites were linked to the Russian troll factory because of the similarities  in style and content  to sites run by the group.
 Kashyrin  added that intellectuals in Kharkiv  especially the IT crowd  dislike Putin and would not support his agenda.
So  Kashyrin  pivoted again.
“ It ’s fun  having Russian propaganda using Ukrainian company ”  Kashyrin  said  despite his claim moments earlier that he would never host Moscow’s agitprop. “It might be the reason these guys choose our company as the provider.”","['That IP address was owned by Greenfloid LLC  a company registered to New Yorker Sergey Kashyrin and two others.

INDIANAPOLIS –  Jon Gruden ’s return to coaching after nearly a decade in broadcasting hasn’t been entirely easy  the new Oakland Raiders coach said Wednesday at the NFL scouting combine.
The challenge hasn’t been building his coaching staff or the process of creating his offensive playbook. Instead   Gruden 's biggest issue has been the fact that nearly two months after he was introduced as the Raiders coach  he hasn’t been able to meet with his players.
NFL rules prohibit contact between coaches and players during the offseason  which stretches from early January (for non-playoff teams) until April .  Gruden  has seen some players in the Raiders’ facility in Alameda  Calif.  but rules bar them from talking about football.
“I always complained about that since the new (collective bargaining agreement) came into place. A lot of players would come to see me in Tampa to get their football fix ”  Gruden  said  “So you're not allowed to have contact with these guys  and what's most discouraging to me is we've got to make some decisions on our roster  on salaries  on players and their futures and you can't even meet them. I don't know these guys. I've never coached them  I've never met half of them. So that's been very  very difficult for me  and I've been emotional about it at times.”
 Gruden  may have a slight advantage on other newly-hired head coaches in that in  his  job as a color analyst for Monday Night Football  he  visited with other teams  coaches and players in recent years.  He  also hosted QB Camp for ESPN  which allowed  him  extensive time with  his  current quarterback  Derek Carr  in the lead-up to the  draft.
For now  most of  his  impressions about the players on  his  current roster come strictly from those prior meetings  what  he  saw when  he  called Raiders games or studied Oakland film.
That includes -year-old running back Marshawn Lynch  who rushed for  yards and seven touchdowns for Oakland last season. The veteran had a -yard performance in a Monday Night Football game against the Philadelphia Eagles that  Gruden  called on Dec. .
“Looking at the film and a game I broadcast on Christmas night  there's no question he's still a beast that's hard to bring down ”  Gruden  said. “One of the reasons I'm excited to be with the Raiders is to join forces with Lynch  but we'll see what happens. We've got to take a look the entire roster  but I'm counting on him being a big part of our football team.”","['Oakland Raiders head coach Jon Gruden  speaks during a press conference at the NFL Combine  Wednesday  Feb.     in Indianapolis.

4211,test,"Star Wars  fans rejoiced when  Lego  unveiled  its  first BB- droid-building kit on Force Friday II  but many wondered: Is it really possible to build a scene-stealing sphere from almost   squares?
We enlisted the help of mega Star Wars fan and  Lego  pro Dan Ulanoff (the author's son) to build and document the process of constructing the -inch-tall BB- replica.
 Lego  tries to simplify the overwhelming number of pieces as much as possible by dividing  them  among six numbered bags that you tackle in order.
After approximately three hours  one lunch break  and no significant issues   Lego BB-  and  his  tiny  original -piece  Lego  BB- were done.
 BB- in Lego form . Image: lance ulanoff/mashable
We were struck by the simple  but effective mechanics built into this  Lego  project. There's a well hidden knob on  BB- 's left side for moving its  Lego  dome head is a  very BB-  fashion  and another on the right for extending the welding torch that  BB-  uses to give Finn a thumbs up sign in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. We don't know if  BB-  plans to use that tool again in the upcoming Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

4213,test,"As chief executive of  his  family’s real estate empire  Jared Kushner planned two apartment projects across the street from each other in Jersey City.
The documents reflect the opaque decisions that  Kushner  and  his  attorneys made to allow  him  to keep much of  his  outside investments while seeking to remain within the boundaries that government ethics officials would find acceptable.
 Kushner ’s form lists hundreds of private companies. Some of the investments  he  kept are held by shell companies that are virtually impossible to track  and  Kushner  has declined to make public more information on those entities.
The  real estate assets that  Kushner  has kept include residential real estate in suburban Maryland  a Times Square retail complex  and apartments across the Midwest  from Toledo to the small town of Speedway  Ind.  Kushner  also kept  his  stake in a New Jersey mobile-home park.
 His  decision to divest from one of the Jersey City projects  One Journal Square  gained attention this month after  his  sister appeared at a conference in China promoting the use of a special U.S. visa program to lure investors for the development and publicly noting her brother’s connection to the president.
The White House said  Kushner  had recused  himself  from discussions of the EB- visa program.
It is not clear from  Kushner ’s financial filings whether any of  his  holdings might intersect with  his  broad and evolving responsibilities in the White House. This week   Kushner  has been close by the president during the administration’s first international trip  with stops in Saudi Arabia  Israel  the Vatican  Belgium and Italy.
 Kushner  rejected a request by The Washington Post to review  his  ethics agreement with the White House  which would lay out the topics that  he  has pledged to avoid because of concerns about conflicts of interest. White House officials have said that it is a long-standing policy for the agreements to remain confidential.
As a result  ethics experts say   Kushner  is asking Americans to take  his  word for it.
 Kushner  declined to comment for this article. One of  his  attorneys  former Clinton administration Justice Department official Jamie Gorelick  said that they were “striving for simplicity” in choosing which assets to sell and which ones to keep to minimize potential areas of conflict.
For instance   Kushner  sold  his  interests in  Fifth Avenue  the company’s landmark building in Manhattan  because it may be refinanced and posed many uncertainties.
 He  also sold  his  interests in a venture capital firm because of its investments in broad sectors of the economy  including a health-care company. Had  he  kept  his  interests   Kushner  might have needed to recuse  himself  from discussions related to health care or risk violating a conflicts of interest statute.
 Kushner  sold some assets to a trust controlled by  his  mother. But  his  attorneys have declined to provide details about other buyers  except to say that they include other family members and third-party buyers.
 Kushner ’s team has said that  he  might sell more of  his  holdings. Additionally  they are filing an updated disclosure form to correct several omissions related to positions and stakes in assets that he did not previously list on his form.
But  Kushner  is bound by the ethics guidelines that govern members of the executive staff — including restrictions on participating in actions that could affect an official’s personal financial interest or appear to show favoritism to a close associate or family member.
In Jersey City  the dual apartment projects illustrate the complexity of  Kushner ’s divestiture strategy.","['As chief executive of  his  family’s real estate empire  Jared Kushner planned two apartment projects across the street from each other in Jersey City.', 'The documents reflect the opaque decisions that  Kushner  and  his  attorneys made to allow  him  to keep much of  his  outside investments while seeking to remain within the boundaries that government ethics officials would find acceptable.', ' Kushner ’s form lists hundreds of private companies.

""Make no mistake - any attack on the United States  or our allies  will be defeated. And any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is both effective and overwhelming ""  Mattis  said.
SEOUL (Reuters) -  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  said on Saturday that  he  could not imagine United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea  warning that its rapidly advancing nuclear and missile programs would undermine  not strengthen  its security.
 Mattis  has been at pains during  his  week-long trip to Asia to stress that diplomacy is America's preferred course  a message  he  returned to after top-level military talks in Seoul on Saturday and the tense border area with North Korea on Friday.
Still   he  warned Pyongyang that its military was no match for the U.S.-South Korean alliance  and that diplomacy was most effective ""when backed by credible military force.""
""Make no mistake - any attack on the United States  or our allies  will be defeated. And any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is both effective and overwhelming "" Mattis said.
 Mattis   too  said Kim's behavior had left no room to imagine accepting Pyongyang's nuclear status.
""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States can accept North Korea as a nuclear power ""  Mattis  told a news conference.
Moon  after talks with  Mattis  on Friday  said the ""aggressive deployment"" of U.S. strategic assets in the region  which have included overflights by U.S. bombers  had been effective in deterring the North Korean threat.
Mattis suggested  however  that Pyongyang needed to understand that its weapons programs would not strengthen its defenses. The North says it wants a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.
""If it remains on its current path of ballistic missiles and atomic bombs  it will be counter-productive ""  Mattis  said  adding North Korea would be ""reducing its security.""
During  Mattis'  trip to the inter-Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Friday   he  was briefed on the posture of North Korean artillery.
""Defending against this many LRAs (long-range artillery) is infeasible in my opinion "" Song told  Mattis  at the DMZ  citing a need for strategies to ""offensively neutralize"" the artillery in the event of a conflict.
 Mattis  replied: ""Understood.""
Still   Mattis  reaffirmed to reporters in South Korea that military options do exist to deal with the North Korean threat that spare the South's capital  Seoul.

“Both spoke forthrightly about the obstacles in the relationship and agreed on the need to make progress in all areas ” said a spokeswoman for Britain’s Foreign Office after  Johnson  concluded what was only the third visit to Iran by a British foreign minister in the past  years.
 Johnson  met Ali Akbar Salehi  head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization earlier on Sunday.
On Saturday  Johnson  had talks with  his  Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif about “consular cases of dual nationals” such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe  who Britain says was visiting family on holiday when  she  was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government.
The case has taken on domestic political importance after  Johnson  said last month that Zaghari-Ratcliffe trained journalists  which her employer denies.  Johnson  later apologized. Opponents have called for  him  to resign if  his  comments lead to her serving longer in prison.

Hitting the campaign trail for the first time in more than two weeks  when the charges first disrupted the race   Moore  said the allegations were false and malicious and politicians in both parties were desperate to see  him  fail.
“This is simply dirty politics. It’s a sign of the immorality of our times ”  Moore  told about  supporters who jammed a rural community center in northeast Alabama  speaking just over two weeks before a Dec.  special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed U.S. attorney general earlier this year.
Republican lawmakers in Washington  including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell  have rushed to distance themselves from  Moore  and called for  him  to step down from the race after  he  was accused by several women of sexual assault and misconduct when they were teenagers and  he  was in  his  early . Reuters has not been able to independently verify those allegations.
 Moore  said the allegations were designed to distract from “the true issues” facing people and that Senate leaders understood  he  was difficult to manage and did not want to deal with  him .
“Politicians will stop at nothing to win an election ” said  Moore  who has accused the media of joining in the effort to malign him .
Outside the rally   a man wearing a Moore sticker  pushed away a cameraman as  he  attempted to film  Moore ’s arrival  local media reported. A reporter for the Birmingham News  in a tweet  identified  the man  as Tony Goolsby  the DeKalb County chairman for the  Moore  campaign.
President Donald Trump defended  Moore  last week  but a White House official said Trump would not campaign for  Moore  before the Dec.  special election.
Trump has repeatedly slammed  Moore ’s Democratic opponent  Doug Jones  a former U.S. attorney  calling him a liberal and saying that Jones would not vote for a tax overhaul plan now being debated in Congress.
But Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama told reporters on Monday he had not voted for  Moore   writing in a candidate instead. He did not say whom he wrote in.
 Moore  had largely stayed off the campaign trail and avoided questions since the allegations first surfaced in the Washington Post. The Jones campaign has taken notice and begun criticizing his absence.
Before the rally  a  Moore  representative warned the crowd against any “outbursts” and said  Moore  would not be taking questions.","['HENAGAR  Ala.

With  a gold medal in the snowboard parallel giant slalom  Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic  has become the first woman in Winter Olympics history to win a gold medal in two different sports at the same Olympic Games.
On Saturday  she  emerged victorious in the final run against Germany's Selina Joerg  finishing just . seconds ahead. Joerg took silver in the event  followed by Ramona Theresia Hofmeister  also of Germany  who took bronze.
A week earlier   Ledecka  surprised spectators and herself by taking a gold medal — in skiing.  Ledecka  finished first in the women's super-G in Alpine skiing  finishing several spots ahead of the decorated American skier Lindsey Vonn.
But  Ledecka  is best known and has seen the most success as a snowboarder  where  she 's won world titles and competed in the Winter Games in Sochi four years ago.
 Ledecka  is the third athlete to win gold in two events in the same Winter Games  according to analytics company Gracenote. The last time it happened was in   with Johan Grøttumsbråten taking gold in the Nordic combined and cross-country skiing. Four years earlier  Thorleif Haug achieved the same thing  the company says.

The problem for chains like Jewel and  Mariano’s  is that shoppers are increasingly buying their groceries from more than one store  said Dan Tausk  a principal at Oakbrook Terrace-based retail brokerage Mid-American Real Estate Group.

 Mariano’s  also continues to evolve since its parent company  Roundy’s  was acquired by Kroger for $ million in .
Since that acquisition  Kroger has largely left  Mariano ’s to make its own decisions  said Don Rosanova   Mariano’s  president.
But  Mariano ’s — best known for its prepared food offerings on the perimeters of the store — has availed  itself  of some of Kroger’s infrastructure to grow the business. Last year  the -store chain opened its first Mariano’s-branded gas station outside the new Lombard store.  Mariano ’s shoppers can earn fuel discounts by racking up reward points buying groceries  Rosanova said.
 Mariano’s  is also phasing in some of Kroger’s store brands to replace existing  Mariano ’s store brands  Rosanova said. For example  most Roundy’s Simply Organic products have been replaced by Kroger’s Simple Truth brand. And in some locations  such as the new Bannockburn store  the chain is testing whether Starbucks performs better than Vero Coffee   Mariano’s  original in-store coffee concept   he  said.
Despite such changes  Rosanova said   Mariano ’s remains committed to its distinct in-store experience and is placing even more focus on convenience throughout the store.
“I’m responsible for protecting the Mariano’s brand ” Rosanova said. “We’re not going to do anything to jeopardize what we’ve established for the last seven years.”

4230,test,"California Republican Devin Nunes is at the center of a frenzied uproar in Washington with Friday's release of a secret memo on FBI surveillance.
The controversy comes with the -year-old chairman of the House intelligence committee on a rocky  rapid rise to power in President Trump's Republican Party — an ascent that required something of an about-face. Once an aggressive critic of the GOP's populist right flank   Nunes  has become a key Trump defender and champion of the party's most conservative wing.
 Nunes  began  his  congressional career at age   under the wing of former Rep. Bill Thomas  R-Calif.  the powerful and respected chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.  Nunes  befriended Thomas  and  his  staffer Kevin McCarthy  years earlier when  Nunes  served on the board of a local college.
Thomas nurtured Nunes' career  helping him earn a seat on the Ways and Means Committee. Five years later  McCarthy was elected to fill Thomas' House seat and immediately became part of  a powerful political alliance with Reps. Eric Cantor  R-Va .  and Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  known as the Young Guns. That trio was the face of a new generation of political conservatives and by  all three were in House leadership.  Nunes  was one of their closest allies.
In the years since  McCarthy was elected House majority leader  Ryan became speaker  and  Nunes  was selected to lead the House intelligence committee. He also remains a prominent member of Ways and Means  where he helped craft last year's sweeping tax code overhaul.
His power and style evolved as he rose to prominence within the House GOP. In   he famously criticized members of the Tea Party for forcing a government shutdown over what he called an unreasonable demand to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Nunes  was quoted in a Washington Post article at the time calling those far-right members ""lemmings with suicide vests.""
 Nunes  served on Trump's transition team and has been one of the president's most ardent defenders.
Here are the five key factors you need to know to understand  Devin Nunes'  role in the Russia probe and the secret memo released Friday.
.  Nunes  rose to prominence during House investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.
The House Intelligence Committee was involved in the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was serving as secretary of state under President Barack Obama.  Nunes  pressed for detailed information on Clinton's handling of classified information throughout the investigation  ultimately floating the idea that Clinton and her presidential campaign could be denied classified briefings.
""Should Hillary Clinton's staff be given classified briefings at this point? I think it is a question that needs to be answered ""  Nunes  said in an interview on Fox News.
.  Nunes  got close to Trump during the election and as a member of the Trump transition team.
Many political analysts point to the  presidential campaign as the moment when  Nunes  began to shift from a GOP traditionalist to a loyal ally of Trump's populist movement.  Nunes  offered intelligence briefings to all of the Republican candidates in   and Trump took him up on that. The two forged a bond as they traveled around California in Trump's campaign plane.
 Nunes  and Trump attended fundraisers and rallies across the state  working closely on an unlikely bid to rally the intensely Democratic state behind Trump's campaign. Within days of the election  Trump named Nunes as a member of the executive committee that would run his transition.
.  Nunes  and  his  Democratic counterpart on House intel were once close  but now Democrats want him removed.
That all ended as the probe devolved into an all-out partisan brawl  involving ties between  Nunes  and the White House. The two sides are at war over the release of the memo  and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have both called on Ryan to remove  Nunes  as chairman of the intelligence committee.","[""California Republican Devin Nunes is at the center of a frenzied uproar in Washington with Friday's release of a secret memo on FBI surveillance."", ""The controversy comes with the -year-old chairman of the House intelligence committee on a rocky  rapid rise to power in President Trump's Republican Party — an ascent that required something of an about-face.

4233,test,"White House chief of staff John Kelly has come under fire for his defense of Rob Porter  who resigned as White House staff secretary Wednesday after his two ex-wives publicly accused him of domestic abuse.
In the wake of  White House staff secretary Rob Porter 's resignation on Wednesday amid multiple accusations of domestic abuse  White House chief of staff John Kelly has found  himself  ensnared in the mounting scandal.
A growing chorus of West Wing staffers and Republicans have begun to question why  he  came out to bat for  Porter  — and whether Kelly had known about the allegations against  him .
At first  Kelly defended  Porter  after  his  second ex-wife Jennifer Willoughby accused  him  of emotional and physical abuse.
Kelly called  Porter  ""a man of true integrity and honor and I can’t say enough good things about  him .  He  is a friend  a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside  him .""
On Wednesday  Porter's first ex-wife Colbie Holderness came out with accusations of her own against  Porter  that included domestic battery and verbal abuse on their honeymoon. She backed up her claims with a photo of a black eye she said  Porter  gave her.
Kelly  who had worked closely with  Porter  for several months  then issued a statement speaking out against domestic abuse in general without specifically condemning  Porter  himself.
""I was shocked by the new allegations released today against  Rob Porter  "" Kelly said. ""There is no place for domestic violence in our society.""
""I think it's fair to say that we all could have done better over the last few days in dealing with the situation "" he said  ""but this was a Rob Porter that many of us dealt with  and the emerging reports were not reflective of the individual we had come to know.""
Despite Shah's insistence the Trump ""maintains full confidence"" in Kelly  a report by Vanity Fair indicates that Trump had become furious with members of his staff after the severity of the  Porter  allegations became clear.
Kelly isn't the only one in hot water  according to the report — his advisers Ivanka Trump  Jared Kushner  and communications director Hope Hicks  who is reportedly dating  Porter   have also drawn the president's ire.
Soon after the revelations about Kelly's knowledge of  Porter 's alleged abuse surfaced  numerous lawmakers have stepped forward to call on the retired general to resign.","['White House chief of staff John Kelly has come under fire for his defense of Rob Porter  who resigned as White House staff secretary Wednesday after his two ex-wives publicly accused him of domestic abuse.', ""In the wake of  White House staff secretary Rob Porter 's resignation on Wednesday amid multiple accusations of domestic abuse  White House chief of staff John Kelly has found  himself  ensnared in the mounting scandal."", 'A growing chorus of West Wing staffers and Republicans have begun to question why  he  came out to bat for  Porter  — and whether Kelly had known about the allegations against  him .', 'At first  Kelly defended  Porter  after  his  second ex-wife Jennifer Willoughby accused  him  of emotional and physical abuse.', 'Kelly called  Porter  ""a man of true integrity and honor and I can’t say enough good things about  him .

As the  NFL season approached and  Colin Kaepernick  remained jobless  civil rights activist Harry Edwards felt compelled to send Commissioner Roger Goodell an email.
âTo make a martyr out of  Kaepernick  under these circumstances is not only counterproductive  as I tried to explain to Roger  itâs absolutely masochistic ââ Edwards told USA TODAY Sports. âAll they had to do is say âWeâre going to give him a shot.â Thatâs all they had to do.ââ
 Kaepernick   a free agent quarterback who parted ways with the San Francisco  after last season  has yet to get a shot to continue his NFL career after emerging as a controversial figure for taking a knee during the national anthem and speaking about social injustice.
More: In wake of President Trump's harsh words  it's time for NFL owners to sign Colin Kaepernick
Last month  a crowd gathered outside the NFL headquarters in New York City and protested amid a belief that team owners have blackballed  Kaepernick  because of  his  on-field protest.
Trumpâs comments last week only elevated  Kaepernick âs status and influence.
âRight now  he âs a walking  talking martyr ââ Rev. Jesse Jackson told USA TODAY Sports.
 Kaepernick   nursing a shoulder injury  was out of uniform and inactive for the game. As the players stood for the national anthem   he  remained seated.
 His  protest went largely unnoticed and unreported. Same thing the following week when the  played the Denver Broncos and  Kaepernick  sat during the anthem but made no extra effort to call attention to  himself . A week later  during the  game against the Green Bay Packers  everything changed.
Jennifer Lee Chan of Niners Nation tweeted out a photo of  Kaepernick  sitting in front of Gatorade coolers during the national anthem. After the game   Kaepernick  confirmed his protest.
Then fighting for the starting job he eventually won back   Kaepernick  made it clear  he  was also fighting for social justice and against police brutality against African Americans.
""This stand wasnât for me ââ  he  said. âThis is because Iâm seeing things happen to people that donât have a voice  people that donât have a platform to talk and have their voices heard  and effect change.ââ
The following week   Kaepernick  decided to kneel rather than sit during the anthem.  He  was joined by teammate Eric Reid  who said they came to the decision to take a knee after meeting with Nate Boyer  a retired Green Beret.
There have been no press conferences and no significant statements by  Kaepernick  since  he  and the  parted ways by mutual agreement after the  season. In March  several news media outlets reported that  Kaepernick  no longer planned to kneel during the national anthem.

4243,test,"Justine Uvuza  wondered that  and decided to find out. A Rwandan herself who had grown up in a refugee camp in Uganda and then moved back to Rwanda in   after the genocide   she  worked for a while for the Kagame government promoting Rwanda's pro-women policies.  She  was curious how much progress had been made. So when  she  was getting  her  Ph.D. at Newcastle University   she  returned to Rwanda to interview female politicians about their lives â not just their public positions but their private lives  with their husbands and children.  She  found with rare exception that no matter how powerful these women were in public  that power didn't extend into their own homes.
""One told me how  her  husband expected  her  to make sure that his shoes were polished  the water was put in the bathroom for him  his clothes were ironed ""  Justine  says. And this husband wanted not only his shoes laid out in the morning  but his socks placed on top of the shoes. And he wanted it done by his wife  the parliamentarian.
 Justine  heard countless stories like this â women were still expected to perform even ceremonial domestic duties. It was rarely an option to outsource such tasks to a maid or get your husband to shoulder more work at home. Some women feared violence from their husbands if they didn't comply with these expectations  and one said that  she  had felt so trapped   she  had contemplated suicide.
 Justine  says that for some of these women  the very real strides that they were making outside the home could feel less like liberation and more like a duty to be fulfilled. Being a ""good Rwandan "" as  she  termed it in  her  research  meant both being patriotic â serving  her  country through  her  public work and career â but also being docile and serving  her  husband. As a result   Justine  said  a female politician could stand up in parliament  advocating for issues like stronger penalties for sexual violence and subsidized maxi-pads for the poor  but find  herself  scared to speak out about the oppression in  her  own home.
And so  Justine  would end each interview asking these female legislators what seemed to  her  to be an obvious question: Would they support a Rwandan women's movement? A movement to change not just the public roles for women but to re-evaluate gender relations on all levels? Would these powerful Rwandan women be willing to stand under the banner of feminism?
Almost all of the women said no. Feminism? ""That's not Rwandan "" they told  her . ""That's for Westerners.""
 Justine  was not shocked. In fact   she  had held the same views earlier in  her  life.  She  says that because of the way that gender equality came so rapidly to Rwanda  from the outside in  with no psychological buildup or women's lib movement  it was harder for these politicians to talk about equality without appearing disloyal  not just to their spouses but to their country.
 She  wishes a debate over the limits of equality could take place in Rwanda.
Born in    she  was frustrated by the anti-woman attitudes  she  faced in high school. When it came time to pick a university   she  applied to the Akilah Institute for Women  Rwanda's first all-women's college  which was established in  as a three-year vocational school. Akilah wasn't as prestigious as the four-year universities that some of  her  peers elected to attend. But Mireille wanted to be in a place where girls could lead clubs and ask a lot of questions in class without worrying about sounding too selfish  too American  too foreign.
The answer  Justine  gave me is that real change takes time. Taking a shortcut can get you somewhere fast  but it leaves the next generation to circle back and address changes that were left undone.
 She  told me that after all  her  interviews with the female politicians   she  had to destroy the transcripts of those conversations. It was part of the rules of  her  university research. But it was more than that. For some of the women  this promise of anonymity was the only way  she  could get them to talk to  her  with candor.
 Justine  not only erased all the tapes;  she  took the typed transcripts and  page by page  set  them  on fire.
But  she  didn't follow the rules to a T.  She  kept a single copy of the interviews in a place that only she knows.  She  hopes that one day  these kind of stories will be heard by the people of Rwanda. Then   she  says  the whole country will finally be ready to have that debate about how to move forward.","[""Justine Uvuza  wondered that  and decided to find out.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other GOP senators on Nov.  called on  Roy Moore  to withdraw from a Senate race in Alabama if allegations of sexual misconduct are true. (Jordan Frasier Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)
A growing chorus of Republicans  including President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  have called on  Senate candidate Roy Moore  to withdraw from a special election in Alabama if allegations prove true that the former judge initiated a sexual encounter with a -year-old girl nearly four decades ago.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders  who was accompanying Trump as he traveled from China to Vietnam on Friday  said  âLike most Americans  the president does not believe we can allow a mere allegation  in this case one from many years ago  to destroy a personâs life. However  the president also believes that if these allegations are true   Judge Moore  will do the right thing and step aside.â
Other Republican senators weighing in included Jeff Flake of Arizona  David Perdue of Georgia  John Thune of South Dakota  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska  Cory Gardner of Colorado  Richard C. Shelby of Alabama and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called on  Moore  to step aside as well â and without couching his statement with âif trueâ language.

 Moore  has denied the allegations and given no indication that  he  will exit the race. âOur children and grandchildrenâs futures are on the line â  he  tweeted Thursday. âSo rest assured â I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!â  Moore  also emailed a fundraising pitch off the revelations. âI believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values â  he  wrote.
The state Republican Party has the power to disqualify  Moore  from the election  according to the Alabama secretary of state. If that happens  McConnell and other Republicans would face the challenge of figuring out which candidate would run in Mooreâs place â and how to win an election in which it is too late to replace the former judgeâs name on the Dec.  ballot.
Under Alabama state law  the ballot cannot be changed within  days of an election. However  in the event of either disqualification or withdrawal  votes cast for  Moore  would not be certified.
In addition  state law allows write-in votes to be cast in general elections  as long as the names are for living people and written in without using a rubber stamp or stick-on label. Despite a state law barring candidates from appearing twice on ballots in the same election cycle  Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.)  who lost in the primary to  Moore   would be an eligible write-in candidate  said John Bennett  an official at the state secretary of stateâs office.
Several state Republicans suggested Thursday that the party is unlikely to disqualify  Moore .

4250,test,"A smiling Roy Moore  stood shoulder to shoulder with  his  fiercest religious allies.
Flanked by a huge sign for  Moore 's Senate campaign  one supporter railed against the ""LGBT mafia"" and ""homosexualist gay terrorism."" Another warned that ""homosexual sodomy"" destroys those who participate in it and the nations that allow it. And still another described same-sex marriage as ""a mirage"" because ""it's phony and fake.""
Thursday's news conference was designed to send a powerful message to the political world that religious conservatives across America remain committed to  Moore   a Christian conservative and former judge whose Alabama Senate campaign has been rocked by mounting allegations of sexual misconduct. The event also revealed an aggressive strain of homophobia rarely seen in mainstream politics â in recent years  at least.
But in a Senate campaign suddenly hyper focused on  Moore 's relationships with teenage girls decades ago   Moore 's hardline stance on gay rights and other LGBT issues has become little more than an afterthought for many voters as Election Day approaches.
 Moore  first caught the attention of many in the LGBT community after describing homosexual conduct as ""an inherent evil against which children must be protected"" in a  child custody case involving a lesbian mother. In a  television interview   Moore  said ""homosexual conduct should be illegal.""  He  also said there's no difference between gay sex and sex with a cow  horse or dog.
 Moore 's stand â combined with the fiery comments from his supporters â unnerved some in Birmingham's relatively small LGBT community.
Indeed  other LGBT activists suggested this week that open acceptance of  Moore 's anti-gay rhetoric harkens to a dark and violent time in Alabama history.
 Moore 's Democratic challenger  Doug Jones  is known best  perhaps  for prosecuting the men who bombed Birmingham's  Street Baptist Church â a prosecution that came nearly  years after the  crime that killed four black girls. Racial tensions have lingered in the state  even as the violence lessened. In   Alabama became the last state in the country to overturn its ban on interracial marriage.
She's not laughing at  Moore .
In contrast to many conservative politicians with national ambitions   Moore  has made little attempt to change  his  tone on LGBT issues as equal rights for the gay community has earned increasing acceptance among mainstream America.
 Moore 's hero status among many Christian conservatives was cemented in  when  as the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court   he  refused to comply with a Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.  He  was later suspended  the second time  he  was forcibly removed from the state Supreme Court.
Earlier this month   Moore  said  ""The transgenders don't have rights "" during a news conference  according to the Montgomery Advertiser.
 Moore 's unapologetic positions â and  his  repeated promises to take them to the U.S. Senate if elected on Dec.  â were celebrated at Thursday's news conference by the religious leaders who traveled from as far as Colorado  Ohio and Texas to stand at  his  side.
""We need  Judge Moore  to stand up to the LGBT transgender mafia "" Leiter said.  He  added  ""We need someone with a proven record of facing off against the gay terrorists.""
He offered a pointed message to  Moore 's critics: God ""doesn't send anyone to hell. It's a place you choose to go.""

The affair ended in part after  McDougal  started feeling guilty about it and after Trump made an offensive comment about  her  mother's age as well as a vulgar remark about the anatomy of black men  the magazine reported.
The story said  McDougal  was paid $  during the  presidential campaign for the rights to  her  story of an affair with any ""then-married man"" by the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer  which never ran it.

The company has approached  McDougal  about extending  her  contract barring  her  from talking about Trump in recent months as the behind-the-scenes negotiations to keep porn star Stormy Daniels' allegation of a Trump affair have been made public  the magazine reported.
American Media has said it didn't find  McDougal 's account of an affair with Trump credible and paid her to write fitness columns. In a statement to The New Yorker  the company denied that having exclusive rights to  McDougal 's story left it with any influence over the president  saying that contention ""while flattering  is laughable.""
The White House said Trump denies having an affair with  McDougal . The alleged affair occurred not long after Trump married his third wife  Melania  who had recently given birth to a son  the magazine reported.

4258,test,"Can  Roy Moore  win this thing?
 Moore   a former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice and outspoken social conservative  has been the easy favorite to win the state's U.S. Senate seat since he became the GOP nominee in September. Alabama is a Republican stronghold that hasn't been represented by a Democratic senator since   and it's a state where President Trump is still reliably popular.
However  the election was rocked last week by a Washington Post story  in which four women who alleged that  Moore  dated or tried to date them when they were teens and  he  was in  his  early . The most serious allegations come from Leigh Corfmann  who said that  Moore  undressed and touched  her  when  she  was  and  he  was  in .
It's impossible to know whether the allegations  which are disputed by  Moore   will cost  him  the Senate race. But what we do know is that they are disturbing and hard to debunk.
So  he  could still win?
Yes  it's easy to imagine a scenario in which  Moore  wins despite the allegations. But it's also possible that Democrat Doug Jones  a former U.S. Attorney who made his name prosecuting Klansmen and domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph  could pull out a win.
Some experts on Alabama politics insist that  Moore  is still the favorite and will likely be elected  albeit narrowly. Conservative writer Quin Hillyer  who has been critical of  Moore  and Mr. Trump and once ran for Congress in the state  tweeted after the story broke on Thursday that  Moore  was still on track to win.
It won't be.  Moore  will win  -. â Quin Hillyer (@QuinHillyer) November   
""It would it be like pulling an inside straight three times in a row "" Hillyer told CBS News in September  before the latest revelations about  Moore  surfaced  about Jones' chances of winning. ""It's possible but very doubtful. But he has a better chance (against  Moore ) than he would against any other Republican.""
That's because  Moore   even before the Washington Post story broke  had considerable baggage that other Republicans in the state do not.  He  has twice served as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court  an elected position  and twice has been essentially kicked off the bench  first for refusing to remove a giant statue of the Ten Commandments  he  had commissioned  and the second time for refusing to recognize gay marriages.
 Moore  also has a long history of controversial statements  such as  his  contention that the / attacks may have been a divine punishment for America's sins. But while  his  penchant for inflammatory remarks embarrasses many Alabama Republicans  it's also helped  him  develop a hardcore following that allowed  him  to easily triumph over Sen. Luther Strange   the Trump-backed Republican incumbent Moore  knocked off in the September primary.
In a sense  Democrats have lucked out in having Jones on the ballot. He's known as a sober  competent public servant  and with  Moore  struggling in the wake of a sex scandal  he has a very real shot of winning the seat.
But Jones is also quite liberal by Alabama standards  particularly on social issues like abortion. He also has the burden of campaigning as a Democrat in a state where the Democratic Party is deeply unpopular. Before  Moore 's sex scandal  Jones looked like someone who could outperform a typical Democrat running in the state  but did not appear to be quite within striking distance of  Moore .
Plenty of Republicans who dislike  Moore  might vote for  him  anyway if only to stop Sen. Chuck Schumer's Democrats from having another vote in the Senate. Although given the most recent revelations about  Moore   it's also possible that many of these Republicans stay home  which could give Jones the edge if Democrats turn out in droves  which they probably will.
One thing to watch for is how the defenses of  Moore  play out on the ground. As The Washington Post story was about to break  Breitbart  the right-wing news outlet run by former White House adviser Steve Bannon  dismissed the allegations as an invention of liberal reporters. Editors at the website also attempted to downplay the allegations by saying that several of the women  although only teenagers  were technically above the age of consent.
It's a shocking strategy that speaks to Bannon's fears that he could be blamed for  Moore 's loss. Bannon was a supporter of  Moore  during the GOP primary and rushed to take credit for his win. He did this despite the fact that  Moore  won largely for reasons that have nothing to do with Bannon  such as Sen. Strange's own considerable political baggage and low approval rating in the state.","['Can  Roy Moore  win this thing?', "" Moore   a former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice and outspoken social conservative  has been the easy favorite to win the state's U.S. Senate seat since he became the GOP nominee in September.

4259,test,"Over the weekend  internet users began to focus on a company called Strava that published a âheat mapâ showing its users around the world. Strava bills itself as a âsocial-networking app for athletes.â The âheat mapâ showed the location of all the rides  runs  swims  and downhills that its users have taken  as collected by their smartphones and wearables.
Because as bad as the publicly available heat map is  the underlying data that Strava is collecting is a security nightmare for governments around the world. The data being collected could allow anyone with access to it the ability to make a pattern of life map for individual users  some of whom may be very interesting.
Taiwan did not move the base  though. And  as you can see  there are a number of avid Strava users who work there  causally jogging right by the parking lot where the missile launchers are parked.
Now here is the problem. This is only one of several missile bases in Taiwanâan important one  to be sure  but there are others  and some of those locations may still be secret. (At the Middlebury Institute of International studies at Monterey  we try to track these bases pretty closely. Weâre confident we know where several are located  for example  but not all of them.) But  Stravaâs  database has one more piece of information  one that is not accessible through the heat map but would be to the company  any client which might purchase the data and any hacker that might steal  it .  Strava  knows which user made each track. Thatâs charming when  it âs a celebrity uploading a run. But what about a soldier? Soldiers  remember  rotate from one assignment to the next. Which means  Strava  can continue to track each user as  he  or  she  rotates to the next assignment  burning one secret missile base after another with all those calories. Yes  if our user casually jogging by Taiwanese missiles day-after-day suddenly appears deployed to a new location  well thatâs very interesting if you are targeting missiles for Chinaâs Rocket Force.
A fair amount of personal data appears to be shared willingly by users  more than enough to make me uncomfortable. A bigger concern  of course  is whether hackers might be able to breach security and get at the data marked private. If I were a  Strava  employee  Iâd be very careful about what sort of email links I clicked on.
None of this is to blame  Strava   of course.  It  provides a service that lots of people obviously find useful. I myself could use to lose a few pounds. And  of course  it isnât like Taiwanâs efforts at secrecy were super impressive to begin with.

4263,test,"Designer Ruth Carter  â whose previous films include Selma  Malcolm X and Roots â pulled colors  shapes  jewelry  and textures from tribes all over Africa. She says she wanted to tell a story ""of brilliance  royalty  intrigue â you name it. I feel that you can tell a story through clothing.""
One detail  Carter  particularly likes is in the Black Panther suit worn by Chadwick Boseman  who plays T'Challa. The suit was created by Marvel character designer Ryan Meinerding  but the fabric has a triangular surface pattern that's all Carter.
""That triangle is the sacred geometry of Africa ""  Carter  says. ""I call that pattern the 'Okavango' pattern. I felt that it made his suit have this character that would  in the wide shots  make him this superhero but in the close-up  you see this beautiful pattern that is consistent with a lot of the art of Africa and would turn him into this African king.""
 Carter 's costumes needed to evoke an African country that had never been colonized  one that looked toward the future but was based on a real past. So she found inspiration from African art and craft  and indigenous tribal wear from all over the continent. Then she and her team worked to create group drawings of the various groups in Wakanda.
""And we did them as they were centuries ago "" she says. ""Then  it was a process of deciding how we go from there in the past  to where Wakanda would be in the future."" For  Carter  and  her  team  that meant using the same color palette  the same headdresses or beadwork but with more modern sillhouettes. The Dora Milaje  for example  are Wakanda's elite team of female warriors  and they wear bright red military uniforms  a leather harness and beaded tabard  and metal neck rings and armor. It's a striking look that  Carter  created ""based on some of the beloved practices of many indiginous tribes"" like the Maasai of Kenya  the Ndebele of South Africa  the Himba people of Namibia.
But where  Carter  stayed closer to traditional tribal wear for the Dora Milaje  an institution in Wakanda   Carter  looked further into the future with another character  Shuri.  She 's T'Challa's younger sister and the resident tech genius â  her  lab is a science fiction dream and  she  creates and builds all of Wakanda's technology  including the Black Panther suit. For Shuri   Carter  was guided by one scene in the film: Representatives from each tribe have gathered for the King's Challenge â anyone wishing to take the throne must challenge T'Challa to a fight. Shuri wears a traditional costume  including a corset inspired by the Dinka people  and she shouts at one point  ""Can we get a move on? This corset is uncomfortable.
""So she told us right away that that's not where she comes from  that's not where she wants to be mentally ""  Carter  says. From there on out  Shuri dresses in clothes with modern sillhouettes and fabrics â  Carter  chose youthful  vibrant colors overlaid with mesh fabrics or bold outlines. But  Carter  says the shape of  her  clothing still holds meaning.
"" Her  first dress is a white dress and we created the front of it to be this cylindrical round shape â and I was trying to connect shapes within Wakanda so you see them repeat. It's the language of Wakanda.""
 Carter  knows a lot about the world of Wakanda now  but when  she  was first asked to interview for Black Panther   she  thought it was a simple superhero film. ""I knew about him as a superhero  but I didn't know that he lived in a secret place called Wakanda â I knew he was from Africa  but I didn't know that they weren't colonized and they had all different types of tribes within their little hidden country.""
 Carter  says the more she understood about Black Panther and the people of Wakanda  she began to get scared. ""This is  that's gone back fifty years and I'm going to be given the task to create this world on camera for the fans!""
MCEVERS: The concept for the suit came from Marvel's character designer  Ryan Meinerding. The details are all Ruth Carter and her team.
MCEVERS: And then there are costumes that Ruth Carter and her team created to define a character like Shuri  tech genius and T'Challa's younger sister.
 CARTER : Shuri is this Tony Stark of Wakanda. She designs the suit.
 CARTER : I learned from my experience on the ""Black Panther"" more than ever that costume design is art. I could communicate and tell stories through this wonderful medium of adornment. The adornment of Africa has always been a part of their beauty from scarification to bead work to woodwork. You know  I fell in love with it even more.

4265,test,"NEWARK  N.J. â The judge in the bribery trial of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez and a wealthy friend is facing a decision on a motion for a mistrial.
 Menendez  is charged with accepting free flights on a private jet and other gifts from Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen in exchange for political influence. One of the central charges is that  Menendez  pressured executive branch officials to try and resolve an $. million Medicare reimbursement dispute Melgen was embroiled in.
In Sunday's filing  attorneys wrote that they should have been allowed to introduce information  including a document from the official Medicare website  that would have buttressed their contention that  Menendez 's meetings with health officials were focused on confusing and inconsistent Medicare reimbursement policies  and not on Melgen's specific case as the indictment alleges.
They also contend Walls should have allowed testimony from Marc Elias  an attorney who represented Menendez in late  and early  when  Menendez  was being investigated by a Senate ethics committee over the flights on Melgen's plane.
Elias  who was scheduled to testify Thursday but didn't  would have told jurors he sent a letter to ethics investigators saying the flights were being reviewed â a point defense attorneys say could cast doubt on the prosecution's theory that  Menendez  was trying to conceal  his  involvement with Melgen.
In contrast  defense attorneys said in court on Thursday that Walls allowed prosecutors to present evidence including pictures of a luxury hotel where  Menendez  stayed in Paris that was allegedly part of the bribery scheme  and testimony from the manager of the Dominican Republic resort â where  Menendez  visited Melgen â about the resort's various amenities.","['NEWARK  N.J. â\x80\x94 The judge in the bribery trial of U.S. Sen.

4266,test,"Ana delved into arcane land disputes only to reveal they were tied to the deeply embarrassing conduct of associates and family members of Prime Minister Hun Sen and other powerful figures.
The dispute between the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen and The Cambodia Daily appeared on an August front page  in Phnom Penh on Sept.   . Omar HavanaâThe New York Times/Redux
But  running scared from his own immediate future   Hun Sen   Cambodiaâs prime minister of  years  killed the newspaper. With general elections  months away  the Daily had somehow become an unacceptable threat to his pursuit of a fourth  even a fifth  decade in power.
 Hun Sen  called the paper a âthief â telling it to pay or âpack up and go.â  He  might have expected more of a fight but the Daily instead revealed how few assets it actually had to tax.
I obtained the declassification of   or so pages of FBI records  which showed the Bureau had killed its own investigation into a  political massacre in Phnom Penh after developing considerable evidence implicating forces loyal to  Hun Sen â  and finding  it  too hot to handle.
The week after Cambodia celebrates its  year of independence from France this November   Hun Sen  will quietly mark  his    day as premier. But the fact that  his  career is so long has never been reason for anyone to presume it will continue tomorrow.
Early in  his  political life  Cambodiaâs survival  and indeed  Hun Senâs  own  once depended on ending the countryâs political isolation and regaining the Westâs favor.
But now  Hun Sen  neither needs  nor can  he  afford  the post-war political arrangement of openness that  he  once grudgingly accepted.
At    he  finds  himself  at the helm of a country where the median age is  â meaning the typical voter was born about the time the Daily began printing.
But in that -year-old voterâs lifetime  the immediate pressure on  Hun Sen  to placate Western government has also waned. Since   the Cambodian economy has grown nearly  percent  and China has become Phnom Penhâs largest source of foreign aid  obviating much of the need to heed U.S. and European concerns about the rule of law and human rights protection.
 Hun Sen  thus finds  himself  with a freer hand to clamp down on critics just as the ground changes beneath  his  feet.
New generations of voters are less likely to be won over by the shopworn campaign slogans of  his  folkloric rise to power â  his  triumphs over the Khmer Rouge in the    his  negotiation of their surrender in the  â that evoke what are at best fading memories for many if not most.
 Hun Sen   who once boasted of overwhelming print and broadcast media dominance â âYou have one station. I have  stations â  he  taunted the opposition in   â  was found last year to be using Indian and Filipino click farms to buy millions of âlikesâ for  his  Facebook page.
At the same time   Hun Sen  has never willingly accepted defeat at the ballot box  having kept  his  -year grip on power through a mix of intimidation  the adept use of patronage  and manipulation of the courts to harass  his  rivals.
In May of this year   he  warned  he  would be ready to âeliminate  or  peopleâ to prevent  his  own defeat and said Cambodia could return to civil conflict unless  he  won next yearâs vote.
This month   he  mooted the possibility of dissolving Cambodiaâs largest  most popular opposition party.

4271,test,"Lots of folks likely consider themselves the ultimate Star Trek fan  but there's a good chance none could hold a candle to  James Cawley   a -year-old professional Elvis impersonator living in a tiny town in upstate New York.  Cawley  is the owner/curator of the Star Trek Original Series Set Tour in downtown Ticonderoga (population:  )  open to the public for just over a year now.  He  built the thing with sweat equity and money  he  made performing as Elvis  and it's become a bona fide mecca for Trekkies.
The  -square-foot building that houses it certainly doesn't look like much when you roll up  owing to its prior history as a long-shuttered grocery store-turned-dollar store. Inside  though  is an astoundingly precise recreation of the Starship Enterprise sets used during the filming of the series that debuted in  (roughly nine months before  Cawley 's birth) and ran for three seasons before hitting syndication nirvana.
Accuracy is the selling point of  Cawley 's Star Trek experience  and the painstaking fidelity to the original designs is jaw-dropping as you walk the corridors of his Enterprise and peep the transporter room  sickbay  engineering room  the Jefferies tube  and the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance  the bridgeâall laid out exactly as it was at Desilu Studios Stage  in Hollywood a half-century ago. The dimensions and colors are spot-on  the fabrics and ambient sounds piped into the rooms and hallways. The liquid in the squeeze bottles on a table in the back of Bones McCoy's science lab are the correct color and level. Panel buttons sound the familiar klaxon when pressed. Gobos cast the same shadow patterns on the walls that draped over Kirk as he discussed a Klingon menace with Spock and Scotty.
""The drive to get it right is what makes it special  because people grew up with this and they know the details intimatelyâtheir eyes would go to what's wrong  not to what's right ""  Cawley  said during a recent visit to  his  Trek-land. As  he  speaks  a retired couple from Connecticutâwho trekked four hours to take the tour this particular afternoonâgeek out over a Tribble and the authentic gold vest-and-sash costume Kirk wore in the second-season episode ""Mirror Mirror "" both of which sit in a long memorabilia display case nearby.
The tour   Cawley  said  ""is emotional for a lot of people.""  He  pointed to the sliding doors that the thousands of fans who've made the pilgrimage here since last yearâsome from as far away as Ethiopiaâpass through to begin the guided hour-long tour. ""When they go in there  I've had people cry. I've had people say  'I never thought I'd actually see this ' "" Cawley  said  noting that nearly all of the original sets  except for a few pieces that are now in private collections or museums  were destroyed shortly after Star Trek was cancelled in . ""This is wish-fulfillment for a lot of people.""
The set tour is the culmination of two decades' worth of work during which  Cawley  established  himself  as the O.G. of the modern Star Trek fan film.  Cawley  created and starred as Captain Kirk in  his  popular (and mostly self-funded) original web series Star Trek: New Voyages from  until just a few years ago  along the way attracting such Trek luminaries as George ""Sulu"" Takei and Walter ""Chekov"" Koenig to reprise their iconic roles in  his  productions. The hour-long ST:NV episodes were filmed in and around Ticonderoga using Enterprise sets  Cawley  started constructing in  his  grandfather's barn in  purely as hobby  with the idea that  he  and  his  local Trekkie pals could use them to film their own little Star Trek vignettes for kicks.
 Cawley 's Star Trek obsession goes back a lot further than that. Like many children of the    he  and  his  friends ran around the streets playing Star Trek while bedecked in store-bought costumes. When  he  was    Cawley  recalled   he  wanted to make  his  own Kirk costume  so  he  picked up the phone and dialed Paramount Studios in the hopes of speaking to Bill Theiss  the costume designer for the original Star Trek series.
""I've always had this thing where if I take something on  I want it to be right or perfect or as close as I can get it  so that's why I called  "" Cawley  laughed.  He  was patched through to Theiss  who happily provided valuable information about Trek costume patterns and fabrics. The pair became friends  which eventually led to  Cawley  interning for Theiss on Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Soon after  Cawleyâthen an aspiring actorâbegan landing gigs as an Elvis impersonator  finding it to be a quite lucrative career. Theiss died in   and willed  Cawley  blueprints for the original Enterprise sets. The blueprints provided the framework  but to meet his own exacting standards for detail   Cawley  filled in the blanks by watching each Star Trek episode hundreds of times  poring over old set photos  he  acquired  and contacting Trek set designers.
 He  also started buying original Trek set props at auction whenever possible  using  his  sweet Elvis money: ""Elvis has done a lot for me   he 's taken very good care of me for a long time ""  Cawley  laughed.  He  moved the sets into the vacant dollar store on Montcalm Street  he  leased nearly four years ago;  he  now owns the building.
To this day   Cawley  obsesses over the minutia.  He  watches Star Trek episodes like Bill Belichick breaks down game film: Finger on the freeze-frame  eye scanning the smallest details  absorbing patterns and schemes  searching for something  he  may not have seen before. It often leads to little adjustments and fixes to  his  sets.
""I never get sick of it ""  Cawley  says of watching Trek. ""Never.""
A couple of years ago  though   he  started to get sick of making fan films.  He 'd occasionally vent on Trek message boards and Facebook groups that doing New Voyages wasn't much fun anymore  and that the fan-film scene had more drama behind the scenes than on the screen.
By then  a spirit of fraternity and collaboration among myriad Trek fan-film productions began to fracture into acrimonious one-upsmanship and online sniping over whose sets  acting  and special effects were better. There was something of an ""arms race "" too  with fan filmsâ Cawley 's included âspending more and more money on their productions  often through crowdfunding (although  Cawley  still paid for most of the costs out of  his  own pocket).
The latter wasn't a big deal to  Cawley . But the New Voyages episodes  he  was executive-producing ( he 'd already ceded the on-screen Kirk role to another actor) were still in post-production and clocked in around an hour.  He  shut the whole thing down so as not to run afoul of CBS  but still wanted to do something with the sets. To that point they had been closed to everyone except  his  friends and those who volunteered on  his  films.
A subsequent licensing deal with CBSâwith whom  Cawley 's had a long and very good relationshipâstruck last year allowed  him  to throw open the doors for the set tour.

Saeed  a -year-old cub  was abandoned at the Magic World amusement park outside Aleppo as fighting nearby increased.  Simba  was left in the Mosul zoo in Iraq during the height of the ISIS insurgency.
Finally  this week  the lions reached their forever home: the Lions Rock sanctuary in Johannesburg  South Africa  home to  other large cats. There   Simba and Saeed  will be able to grow up in a pride  with plenty of socialization and interaction with other lions.
For  Simba   the journey involved multiple false starts.  He  was turned away at the border and returned to the Mosul zoo once. On the next attempt to move  him   the lion was held by government officials for a few days before being allowed to leave Iraq.
Lions Rock staff say  Simba  and Saeed are now working on gaining trust with  their  keepers  learning very basic commands to enter and exit pens for  their  safety and care.

4274,test,"For  his  first TV appearance since launching  his  campaign for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)   Joe Arpaio  went on Fox & Friends.
 His  recent conviction never came up.
 Arpaio  â a -year-old former sheriff whose conviction for contempt of court in a racial profiling case was pardoned by President Trump last August â was asked four questions by host Steve Doocy during the course of the interview. None of them had to do with  his  long history of civil rights abuses  failure to investigate sex abuse cases  or decades of discriminating against Arizonaâs Latinx community. The closest Doocy got to mentioning  Arpaio âs checkered past was when he introduced him as âknown for being tough on immigration.â
Instead  Arpaio faced a series of softballs. Doocy opened by asking him  âAt   why do you want to do this?â and closed by giving him an opportunity to respond to Flake  who made clear during a CNN interview on Tuesday that he doesnât support  Arpaio  and thinks his candidacy is ânot our best foot forward as Republicans.â
Doocy was eager to help cast  Arpaio  as an acolyte of Trump  who receives almost nothing but fawning coverage on Fox & Friends  a show he regularly live-tweets. After asking  Arpaio  what part of  his  experience as sheriff âwould be most helpful in the U.S. Senate â Doocy followed up by inquiring if  he  wants to âdrain the swampâ like Trump.
âOh  I would have a lot of fun â  Arpaio  replied.
Doocy ended the segment by mistakenly calling  Arpaio  âSenator Joe Arpaioâ and wishing  him  good luck.
Polling released on Tuesday by  TV in Phoenix shows  Arpaio  âskyrocketing to the top of the Republican Primary for U.S. Senate in Arizona â with a hypothetical Trump endorsement bumping his support even higher.","['For  his  first TV appearance since launching  his  campaign for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen.

4275,test,"Make no mistake about what happened in Alabama yesterday;  Roy Moore  was defeated by a united Washington establishment Uniparty that wanted no part of giving Donald Trump another vote in the United States Senate and traditional Judeo-Christian values another voice at the national level.
As our friend Michael Patrick Leahy reported for Breitbart  three secretive Washington  D.C. consulting firms founded by former Obama campaign staffers provided millions of dollars in advertising services  apparently entirely on credit  to Highway   a shell independent expenditure organization based in Birmingham  Alabama that supported liberal Democrat Doug Jones and opposed  conservative Republican Roy Moore .
In a pattern that was established back in the early days of the Tea Party rebellion   Moore  was stripped of any establishment Republican support  even before the scurrilous and unsubstantiated charges of sexual misconduct were raised against  him .
The Washington GOP establishment dumped  Moore  just like it campaigned against Todd Akin  Richard Mourdock and a host of other outsider candidates who might well have won  had the party backed them to the hilt  as it backed damaged establishment candidates like Mississippiâs Senator Thad Cochran.
And we donât mean only monetary support â although that was incredibly important as  Moore  was out spent better than  to  in reports filed before the final push by the shadowy Democrat organizations backing Jones.
Alabamaâs Republican Senator  Richard Shelby  made a point of going on TV the weekend before the election and campaigning against his fellow Republican by saying he would not and did not vote for  Roy Moore .
Instead  he wrote-in the name of a âprominent Republican â and the write-in votes cast for no name candidate Lee Busby and unnamed âprominentâ Republicans look like they would have been enough to clinch the election for  Moore .
And the drumbeat against  Moore  wasnât confined to just Senator Shelby; a bevy of other Republican Senators were all over TV in the last weeks of the campaign saying they wouldnât vote for  Moore  and suggesting darkly that if  he  were elected they would throw  him  out of the Senate.
Senators Cory Gardner  John Thune and Rob Portman all piled on  Roy Moore  and worked against electing  him  â the one chance they had of maintaining the tenuous Republican majority in the Senate.
It is now going to be harder to protect innocent life  enable people to escape poverty  rebuild our national defense and appoint judges to enforce Constitution. So  why would Republicans in the Senate and DC jeopardize their ability to pass their agenda by working so hard against  Roy Moore  â even before  he  was hit by the unproven allegations of sexual misconduct?
McConnell  Gardner  Portman and Thune have no interest in the Trump agenda  the agenda of the conservative movement  or any other agenda. What they are interested in is maintaining their own power and a  Roy Moore  victory would have been a serious impediment to their power  but Doug Jones is merely another Democrat to cut a deal with.
In our article  âThe Despicable Mitch McConnellâ we predicted that Mitch McConnell would  as he did in Mississippi in   pull out all the stops to kill  Roy Mooreâs campaign   even if  it  meant mounting a write-in campaign and syphoning-off enough votes to elect Far-Left Democrat Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate and jeopardizing the Republican majority.

4281,test,"According to  Gerry Galloway   another civil engineering professor at the University of Maryland  in the storm preparedness game  the category of a hurricane  from one to five  was once the measure of potential devastation. ""We learned from Katrina that's not the case "" he said. What people should worry about is rainfall and storm surge (water blown in by hurricane winds)  which may seem intertwined if you've never been on the ground during a hurricane  but are actually two distinct phenomena.
""In the months after Katrina "" said  Galloway   ""the big issue was that there was still water in many places that they were pumping out as fast as they could  and then they'd get another storm  or a hurricane would come in and dump more water.""
More bad news: ""The residents have to recognize that they have a residual risk from the levee they have right now  if you have a Katrina-like event  or something bigger "" Galloway told me. Moreover  with climate change will come sea level rise  and that in turn has the potential to make Katrina-like events  with their once-every--years storm surge  into a horrifyingly common phenomenon.
One thing's for sure: In New Orleans  as with everywhere in the US  it's poor and generally minority communities that suffer the most. In  his  recent work as a visiting professor at Texas A&M   Galloway  told me   he  and A&M professor Sam Brody found that ""areas that flood tend to be areas where there is low income."" That produces a confluence of problems   he  said. Sixty-three percent of Americans can't cobble together $ in an emergency. Meanwhile  the truly poor   he  went on  don't have cars  can't afford plane tickets  and may not be able to afford a motel room at a safer elevation   Galloway  pointed out.
Still   Galloway  told me  ""I expect to have a beignet and coffee at Cafe Du Monde in the year .""  He  said the levee may need to be heightened  but New Orleans will at least survive. Then  he  added  somewhat grimly: ""Maybe not all of the city. That may be one of the solutions you have to deal with. You may have to use part of the city for emergency water storage.""
By ""emergency water storage ""  he  clarified that  he  meant something like the way China evacuates flood basins  relocating sometimes millions of people during monsoon floods as a form of ""water detention."" Forced mass migration certainly doesn't sound like an ideal system  and  Galloway  clarified that  he 's not proposing it for New Orleans.

The outcome is likely to be determined by the consciences of conservatives  and of a specific kind: those who see Mitt Romney and Republicans like him as far more reflective of their moral sense than is  Judge Roy Moore   the GOPâs ethically defective nominee whose indifference to the law led him to be removed from Alabamaâs Supreme Court twice .
Stephen K. Bannon  the former Trump Svengali who proudly peddles the ideological wares of the extreme right  inadvertently clarified the stakes at a Moore rally in south Alabama on Tuesday night with a malicious and spiteful attack on Romney. The former Massachusetts governor tweeted this week that having  Moore  in the Senate âwould be a stain on the GOP and on the nation.â

Bannonâs response? â Judge Roy Moore  has more honor and integrity in that pinkie finger than your entire family has in its whole DNA.â
Yes   he  really said that.
Party loyalty can  itâs true  be honorable if it is about the defense of principles  and  Moore âs backers say they are sticking with  him  to oppose abortion and multiply conservative judges.
But these rationales ring hollow given  Mooreâs  utterly unconservative claims as a judge that  his  theological predilections overrode the law and  his  lies about not profiting from  his  private charity  which suggest  he  is a charlatan exploiting the beliefs of  his  supporters for  his  own purposes.
 Both Moore  and President Trump play on the feelings of marginalization experienced by many cultural conservatives. It would be salutary for such voters to declare that there are limits to how much they will allow themselves to be used by politicians whose words and deeds are so often at odds. If  Moore  is not the limiting case  there are no limits.
 Moore âs promoters  including Bannon  want to convince Alabama Republicans that since a Jones triumph will be taken as a rebuke to Trump  they have an obligation to fall into line. But the long-term harm to the GOP from a  Moore  victory will be far greater than from one lost Senate seat.

4287,test,"Trump Seizes On  Roy Moore Accuser 's Admission Of Adding To Yearbook Inscription
Speaking at a campaign rally Friday night in Florida â but about  miles from the Alabama state line â President Trump seized upon news that one of  GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore's accusers  had added to a yearbook inscription which  she  has offered in support of  her  allegations that  Moore  sexually assaulted  her  when  she  was a teenager decades ago.
""Anytime you see   you know something is going wrong "" the president said about  the celebrity attorney representing Beverly Young Nelson .
 Nelson   who has accused Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore of sexually assaulting  her   years ago  admitted Friday to adding a notation to a high school yearbook inscription  she  says  Moore  wrote in . However   she  still maintains that  Moore 's signature and the message in the yearbook to  her  are both authentic and penned by  Moore .
Nonetheless  Moore  his allies and  his attorney  seized on the admission  pointing to it to argue that  Nelson 's allegations of sexual misconduct against  Moore  are not true. And Trump followed suit hours later  finally getting to talking about the Alabama Senate special election almost  minutes into  his  unwieldy speech that was mostly campaign-style stump rhetoric.
""We cannot afford â this country  the future of this country â cannot afford to lose a seat in the very  very close United States Senate. We can't afford it  folks "" Trump said  echoing previous comments he's made urging people to vote for  Moore  despite the allegations of sexual assault and sexual misconduct from multiple women.
""We want jobs  jobs  jobs  so get out and vote for  Roy Moore  "" the president continued  before returning to his refrains about the economy and foreign policy and to reliving his  victory.
 Moore  was not at the rally  but the timing â Alabama voters go to the polls Tuesday â and chosen location for one of the president's frequent campaign rallies raised questions of whether Trump was trying to help  Moore  even if the two men did not appear together. Trump himself faced multiple accusations of sexual assault during his presidential campaign  which he has denied.
Other national Republicans have distanced themselves from  Moore   and the Senate GOP campaign arm pulled funding from his campaign when multiple accusers came forward last month. But the Republican National Committee  following Trump's full-throated endorsement of  Moore  on Monday  restored financial help for the embattled Senate nominee this week.
Nelson  one of several women who have accused  Moore  of sexual misconduct in recent weeks  alleged that  Moore  groped  her  and tried to force  himself  on  her  while in  his  car. At the time  Nelson said   she  was  and  Moore  was in his .  Her  allegations against  Moore  were made alongside Allred last month and  she  presented the yearbook inscription as proof  she  and  Moore  had known each other  years ago.
In an interview with ABC News Friday  Nelson reiterated that  Moore  signed the yearbook. The inscription says: ""To a sweeter  more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas . Love  Roy More  D.A. -- Olde Hickory House."" Olde Hickory House was the restaurant Nelson worked at in Gadsden  Ala.  where she said she met  Moore  in the .
Conservative media outlets and supporters of  Moore  quickly pounced on the admission as proof that Nelson was not being truthful.
Bryan Fischer  a host on the Christian-oriented American Family Radio tweeted: 
""Roy Moore accuser Beverly Young Nelson  now admits  she  doctored the yearbook note. Oops.""
Wayne Dupree  host of the Wayne Dupree Show  tweeted:  ""Roy Moore Accuser Doctoring Yearbook Inscription  This is one  Beverly Young Nelson won't be able to take back. Will media report or overlook this one on Sunday talk shows??""

4288,test,"In Tuesdayâs Alabama Senate race  no one knows who will come out on topâand thatâs unusual in a reliably conservative state. Thanks to a strange set of circumstances  the special election to fill the Senate seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions has become a competitive race.  Republican Roy Moore  had been viewed as a strong favorite  but that changed when multiple women accused  him  of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers. The allegations  which  Moore  denies  have shaken up the race and given Democrat Doug Jones a shot at winning  though  Moore  maintains a slight edge in polling averages. Pundits and pollsters now deem the Alabama special election âimpossible to predict.â Latest from Politics A Clash Between Two Visions of the Republican Party in Alabama Special elections that take place in a year when midterms arenât held are difficult to poll under any circumstances. Itâs hard for pollsters to predict exactly who will show up to vote when they canât turn to past turnout data in comparable election cycles. The controversy that has engulfed the Alabama senate election as a result of the allegations against  Moore  adds even more volatility to the race. âThis race has almost every factor that makes polling tricky â said Margie Omero  a Democratic pollster and co-host of âThe Pollstersâ podcast. âWe donât know what the electorate is going to be  and you have people trying different methodologies to try to figure out out. Some may prove to be better than others.â
In the final days of the race  the polls have been all over the place. A Fox News poll reported that Jones had a -point lead among likely Alabama voters  while an Emerson College poll showed  Moore  with a nine-point lead over Jones. Fox News polled voters via both landlines and cell phones  while Emerson Collegeâs poll relied on landlines and an online panel. Individuals who only use a cellphone tend to skew younger  and are less likely to be white  which may account for why Jones fared better in the Fox News poll. Itâs impossible to know for sure which model will more accurately predict the final outcome. âDifferent approaches to estimating the likely electorate in Alabama produce widely varying results â pollster Mark Blumenthal of online-survey platform SurveyMonkey wrote on the companyâs blog. Another complication for pollsters is the fact that Alabama doesnât typically have competitive national races. Republican voters outnumber Democrats by roughly a - ratio in Alabama  and the state hasnât sent a Democrat to the Senate in more than two decades. A lot of veteran pollsters havenât spent time polling the state in the past because of that. âVery few people poll Alabama since presidential  Senate  and gubernatorial races are rarely competitive there â said Patrick Murray  the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. âThe more experience pollsters have in a particular state  the better placed they are to understand the contours of what turnout generally looks like in that state.â Murray added that a combination of factors in the Alabama race means that âin terms of predicting turnout  pollsters are just throwing darts.â
The Alabama special election first started looking seriously competitive after reports of Mooreâs alleged past sexual misconduct surfaced in November. On November   The Washington Post reported an allegation from a woman named Leigh Corfman  who said that when she was  years old and  he  was  years old   Moore  initiated sexual contact with  her . Since then  more women have come forward with allegations against  Moore   including a woman named Beverly Young Nelson  who accused  Moore  of sexually assaulting  her  in .  Moore  has denied the allegations  calling them âritual defamation.â After the allegations surfaced  Jones briefly surged in the polls  overtaking  Moore  in polling averages from mid-November until the end of the month. By around November   however   Moore  had regained a lead. The RealClearPolitics polling average indicates that  Moore  has a lead over jones of just . points as of Tuesday morning. A Democratic victory might be within reach if a critical mass of Republicans are turned off by the allegations against  Moore  and decide to sit the election out  and if Democrats turn out in higher numbers than they typically do in Alabama elections. There is evidence that Democratic voters are more energized than Republican voters in the Trump era  but turnout has varied in the different special elections held to replace members of Congress who left to serve in Trumpâs administration.
In Georgiaâs special election in June  Democratic voter turnout was higher than it had been in the same congressional district during the  midterm elections. In the Kansas special election held in April  the Democratic vote decreased relative to the past midterm cycle in the same congressional district. Sensing the potential for a win  some national Democrats  like Senator Cory Booker  have come to the state to campaign for Jones. That might not have happened if the race didn't look competitive. But the very fact that Jones is getting help from national Democratic figures could end up energizing Republican voters to get out the vote  especially in a hyper-partisan political environment. Another factor that could boost Republican turnout: Trump has a higher approval rating in Alabama compared to how heâs ranked nationwide  and the president is all in for  Moore . At a rally in Pensacola  Florida  a city near the Alabama border  on Friday  Trump implored anyone listening to âget out and vote for  Roy Moore .â âRepublican base turnout might be depressed  but Republican voters might also end up rallying in support of  Moore  â Tom Bonier  the CEO of Democratic data firm TargetSmart said. âEach poll presents a different potential outcome in turnout.

WASHINGTON â Sen. Marco Rubio  R-Fla.  fired Chief of Staff Clint Reed Saturday following allegations of âimproper conduct â with employees in the senatorâs office.
In a statement his office released late Saturday   Rubio  said the staffer âhad violated office policies regarding proper relations between a supervisor and their subordinates. I further concluded that this led to actions which in my judgement amounted to threats to withhold employment benefits.â
The statement does not mention Reed by name. But a spokeswoman for  Rubio  confirmed it was Reed who was fired. She would not elaborate further about the allegations beyond the statement.
 Rubio  said  he  was first made aware of the allegations of improper conduct on Saturday  according to the statement.
 Rubio  flew to Washington Saturday evening and fired Reed 
âWe have taken steps to ensure that those impacted by this conduct have access to any services they may require now or in the future â  Rubio  said in the statement. âPursuant to the wishes of those victimized by this conduct  we will not be disclosing any further details about the incidents which occurred. We will be formally notifying the appropriate congressional and Senate administrative offices of this matter when they return to work Monday morning.â
Reed has been Rubioâs chief of staff since January . Before that  the native Arkansan had managed  Rubio âs  re-election campaign following the senatorâs unsuccessful presidential run.","['Sen.

4292,test,"SHAPIRO: We're going to call them  Manuel  and V.
SHAPIRO: By now you might have guessed  Manuel  is in immigration detention. We've watched  his  absence ripple through  his  family and community in ways that continue today. The first time we meet the family in September   Manuel  has already been locked up for five months.  His  boys range from  to  years old. The oldest has temporary protection under the program called DACA.  He  was brought over as an infant. The younger three are U.S. citizens.
SHAPIRO: Here's how that relates to his parents' story.  Manuel  and V were born in Sinaloa  Mexico.  They  went to elementary school together. When  they  started dating as teenagers  V's family objected because  Manuel's family was poor .  Her  relatives had connections to the Sinaloa drug cartel  and they tried to kill  Manuel . Over a couple years  they beat  him  up  put a gun to  his  head and tried to run  him  over with a car. That's all according to  his  testimony in immigration court. Those death threats will turn out to be important later in the story.
In   he crossed the border and got caught in the U.S. He could have asked for asylum  but he was . He didn't understand immigration law. So ICE issued a deportation order  one that still stands today  and he was sent back to Mexico. Three days later  he crossed into the U.S. again  and he's been quietly flying under the radar ever since  working and raising a family until one day last April. At : in the morning  a local police officer came to  Manuel 's house with immigration agents. We spoke to  Manuel  on a crackly phone line from the Northwest Detention Center just south of Seattle.
SHAPIRO: The cop said the officers came to investigate a report that  Manuel  was driving a stolen car. When  Manuel  told them  he  owned the car  the immigration agents demanded his citizenship papers. Then they put  Manuel  in handcuffs. Incidentally  police could not produce any report about that stolen car.
 MANUEL : (Through interpreter) I asked  please let me say goodbye to my wife. And the other official in Spanish said  OK  go ahead. Say goodbye. They took me towards her  and he let me say goodbye  but I haven't seen her since.
SHAPIRO: In the five months that  Manuel  has been locked up  the family has had to change all their routines. The oldest son dropped out of college. There was no money for tuition  and he needed to support the family  so now he's working as a firefighter. At the same time  he doesn't know what his own future will be. He has temporary permission to stay in the country under DACA. The fight over renewing that program is part of what led to this week's government shutdown. In the detention center   Manuel  feels helpless  unable to provide for  his  family or comfort  his  children.  He  tries to talk to them on the phone every night.
SHAPIRO: We got his Immigration and Customs Enforcement file. And since his illegal border crossing nearly  years ago   Manuel  has not been charged with any crimes.  He  had three jobs to support  his  family - restaurant work and cleaning. The detention center where  he 's staying is supposed to be for holding people  not punishing them. But to Manuel  the place feels punishing. When he was picked up in April   people were on hunger strike  protesting the conditions at the Northwest Detention Center. Now in September  I ask what it's like inside.
SHAPIRO: The company GEO Group which operates the detention center told us they strongly deny these allegations. Every time I call  Manuel    he  says  he 's hopeful and confident that  he 'll be reunited with  his  family.  His  optimism gets tested every time one of  his  friends in detention gets deported. Many of them have cases just like  his .
SHAPIRO: He told me about  percent of the people ICE arrests have a prior run-in with the courts. But that  percent includes  Manuel  because  he  had a deportation order for crossing the border about  years ago.
SHAPIRO: Just down the block from  Manuel  and V's home in the Pacific Northwest  we stop by a yard sale to talk to some of the people looking through used clothes and furniture. It's a crisp afternoon  and lawns are scattered with fallen leaves.
SHAPIRO: At last in mid-September   Manuel 's court date arrives.  He 's been locked up nearly half a year. If  he  loses today  the next time  he  leaves the detention center could be with a one-way ticket to Mexico.
SHAPIRO:  Manuel 's application to stay in the U.S. is denied. These are the words everyone was hoping not to hear.
SHAPIRO: Manuel calls his wife  V  in despair and tells her to send all his clothes to Mexico so when he's deported  he'll have something to wear. She empties out his closets. There is one small sliver of hope. Manuel can ask the judge to reconsider. That might take months  time that he would spend locked up. The alternative is to accept deportation and try to start making some money in Mexico for his family in the U.S. Even the oldest son's relentless optimism seems to be failing him.
SHAPIRO: Manuel decides that if there is any tiny chance that he can see his wife and children again  he needs to keep fighting. He does have one thing going for him that most immigrants in the system don't. After the deportation ruling  a lawyer named Andrea Lino takes on his case.
In Mexico   Manuel's elderly mother  gets a phone call at  her  home. The Sinaloa Cartel has been watching. The caller says Manuel was deported and kidnapped at the border. The caller demands a ransom and threatens to kill her son.  Manuel's mother  knows that this is a bluff.

4296,test,"ISLAMABAD (AP) â  Pakistan's former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif  failed to appear on Monday before an anti-graft tribunal where  he  was to be indicted on corruption charges along with several family members and co-defendants in the case.
Meanwhile  authorities arrested  Sharif 's son-in-law  also a co-defendant in the case. The son-in-law  Mohammad Safdar was taken into custody at the Islamabad airport after he and his wife  Maryam Nawaz  arrived from London  said Cabinet minister Talal Chaudhry.
The corruption charges against  Sharif    his  two sons  daughter and son-in-law stem from an investigation into documents leaked from a Panama law firm that showed the Sharifs had undisclosed assets abroad.
 Sharif  is currently in London with  his  wife Kulsoom Nawaz  who is said to be recovering from throat cancer surgery.
The Supreme Court disqualified  Sharif  from office in July  forcing  him  to step down over corruption allegations and undisclosed assets.  Sharif  has denied any wrongdoing.  He  and some of  his  party leaders have claimed there are ""hidden hands"" behind  his  dismissal and spate of corruption cases.
Last week   Sharif  appeared before the anti-corruption court but the tribunal had to delay  his  indictment after  his  children  who are co-defendants in the case  failed to appear before Judge Mohammad Bashir.
 Sharif 's lawyer Khawaja Haris on Monday requested that the judge exempt  Sharif  from appearing. The judge reserved his decision on the request but granted Sharif's daughter and  her  husband bail. He also adjourned the case till Oct. .
 Sharif 's ruling party expressed anger over Safdar's arrest.
 Sharif 's two sons  who also skipped out on Monday's hearing  are also said to be in London with their ailing mother.

4309,test,"WASHINGTON â Robert Mueller to  Paul Manafort : Iâm watching you.
Revealing that they know every word  Manafort  changed in a recently published op-ed  prosecutors for the special counsel argued Friday that the former Trump campaign chairmanâs attempt to mount a public relations campaign to defend himself while under house arrest âraises serious concerns about his trustworthiness.â
Prosecutors are now pushing for him to remain confined to his home after they discovered he was heavily involved in the drafting of an opinion piece about his involvement in Ukrainian politics. They say the op-ed was part of a public effort  Manafort  was trying to orchestrate that would have violated a judgeâs order to refrain from trying his case in the press.
In court papers earlier this week  Muellerâs office had accused  Manafort  of ghostwriting the op-ed with a colleague who they said had ties to Russian intelligence.
Paul Manafort's Brooklyn brownstone hit with stop-work order
Manafortâs attorneys had argued that  Manafort  had only edited the piece after receiving it from a former Ukrainian public official whom he knew through his consulting work in Ukraine. They also said  Manafort  hadnât violated the judgeâs order and was exercising his free speech rights to defend himself.
Writing in Microsoft Word   Manafort  changed several sections of the essay  going line-by-line for over  minutes on the night of Nov.   court papers show.
Each change was tracked in the document  which prosecutors later compared to talking points  Manafort  drafted last year to respond to news reports about  his  consulting work in Ukraine. They found they mirrored  his  edits  and appeared to show  he  had a âpublic relations campaignâ in mind to help  his  case.
 Manafort  given until Thursday to explain op-ed about Ukraine work
Prosecutors learned of the effort last week  and earlier this week  they received assurances from  Manafort âs attorney that the op-ed wouldnât be published. Nevertheless  the op-ed was published Thursday in an English-language newspaper in Ukraine under the byline of Oleg Voloshyn  a former Ukrainian official.
Voloshyn told The Associated Press this week that he authored the op-ed in  Manafort âs defense and insisted  Manafort  did not help him draft it.
Voloshyn did acknowledge that he sent  Manafort  a draft of the op-ed through Konstantin Kilimnik  a longtime employee of Manafortâs in Ukraine. Kilimnik appears to be the person prosecutors referred to as âassessed to have tiesâ to Russian intelligence.

In addition to the op-ed  prosecutors also detailed that they have amassed hundreds of thousands of documents and executed  search warrants as part of their investigation into  Manafort  and his longtime business associate  Rick Gates. The government has gathered financial records from Cyprus and St. Vincent and the Grenadines  and also seized multiple electronic devices during a raid of Manafortâs Virginia home this past summer.
 Manafort  and Gates face multiple counts of conspiring to launder money  conspiring against the U.S. and giving false statements to the government. Both men pleaded not guilty.","['WASHINGTON â\x80\x94 Robert Mueller to  Paul Manafort : Iâ\x80\x99m watching you.', 'Revealing that they know every word  Manafort  changed in a recently published op-ed  prosecutors for the special counsel argued Friday that the former Trump campaign chairmanâ\x80\x99s attempt to mount a public relations campaign to defend himself while under house arrest â\x80\x9craises serious concerns about his trustworthiness.â\x80\x9d', 'Prosecutors are now pushing for him to remain confined to his home after they discovered he was heavily involved in the drafting of an opinion piece about his involvement in Ukrainian politics.

4310,test,"A pastor in Alabama said he received a voice mail Tuesday from an individual falsely claimed to be a reporter with The Washington Post and seeking women ""willing to make damaging remarks"" about  Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore  in exchange for money. The call comes days after The Post reported on allegations that -year-old Moore initiated a sexual encounter with a -year-old girl nearly four decades ago  sparking calls by some Republicans for him to abandon his campaign for the U.S. Senate in a special election to be held Dec. .
Pastor Al Moore of Creola  Alabama  said that he received the call on his cellphone a little after  a.m. Tuesday from a private number  which he did not answer. The caller  claiming to be ""Bernie Bernstein "" left a -second voicemail  which  Moore  played for local CBS-affiliate WKRG.
""I'm a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of  to  years old  willing to make damaging remarks about  candidate Roy Moore  for a reward of between   and   dollars "" the caller said in the voice mail.
 Moore  said  he  mentioned the call to a couple of members of the church and quickly realized that it didn't add up. The caller first referred to himself as ""Bernie"" and then later gave his name as ""Al.""  Moore  also sent an email to the address left in the voice mail  which bounced back.
 His  church  the Fountain Of Faith Baptist Church  posted on Facebook Tuesday morning about a call from an ""Al Bernstein at the Washington Post. Hmmmm.""
 John Rogers  a spokesman for the Roy Moore campaign   could not be immediately reached by The Post.  He  told WKRG reporter Bill Riales that  he  hadn't previously heard about the call.
 Al Moore  told Riales that  he  is in no way related to  Roy Moore   even though they share the same last name.  The pastor  said  he  thought the voice mail was from a robocall meant to stir up an already divisive race  and  he  reached out to WKRG because ""people are just going crazy with this.""
""Let's let the people who are investigating do their job and expose it if it's real  and shut it if it's not ""  he  said.
In The Post's investigation published last week  Leigh Corfman alleged that  Roy Moore  initiated a sexual encounter with her in   when she was  years old and  he  was . Three other women  all on the record  have said that  Roy Moore  pursued them when they were between  and  years old. A fifth woman came forward on Monday  saying  Roy Moore  sexually assaulted her in the  when she was .
Since The Post's report  the fact-checking site Snopes debunked unsubstantiated rumors that The Post had paid Corfman to go on the record and accuse  Roy Moore  of sexual misconduct. Post spokeswoman Molly Gannon Conway called the accusation ""categorically false "" adding that The Post has ""an explicit policy that prohibits paying sources.""
Neither Corfman nor any of the other women sought out The Post. While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of  Roy Moore 's Senate campaign  a Post reporter heard that  Moore  allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls. Over the ensuing three weeks  two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women. All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews  saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with  Moore . The women say they don't know one another.
 Roy Moore  has denied the allegations  and has showed no indication that  he  intends to bow out of the race. Speaking at Walker Springs Road Baptist Church in rural south Alabama Tuesday evening  the senate candidate said he knows he has ""made a few people mad.""
""I'm the only one who can unite Democrats and Republicans  because I'm opposed by both. They've done everything they could  and now they are together to try to keep me from going to Washington ""  Moore  said.
Voters in Alabama told The Post that they feel torn about the allegations. Some evangelicals in Alabama still consider  Moore  a champion of their faith - a politician willing to stand up for Christian values. But other evangelicals feel the allegations force them to make an uncomfortable decision.

4320,test,"When  Chicago blues musician Eddie Shaw  played  his  saxophone  the room seemed to quake.
 His  immense  raspy  growling sound cut through the instrumentals surrounding  him .  His  ornate solos packed vast swaths of blues and jazz history into every roaring phrase.
 Shaw  parlayed those exhortations into that rarest of careers in the blues: a prominent bandleader who wasnât primarily a guitarist  harmonica player or singer (though  Shaw  could shout a vocal line with power and play harmonica compellingly too). The range of Shawâs talents and the durability of  his  career made  him  legendary among blues listeners in Chicago and around the world.
 Shaw  died early Tuesday morning in Chicago at age  of natural causes  said  his  son  James Jones.
â Eddie  had one of those big  fat old tenor sounds  that kind of R&B sound â lots of vibrato â said Bruce Iglauer  founder-president of the Chicago blues label Alligator Records.
â Eddie  was like a jazz musician who was in the blues field.â
 Shaw âs playing  in other words  was more than just sound and fury: There was a complex musical underpinning to the solos  he  crafted.
Like many blues masters who made their names in Chicago   Shaw  began  his  journey in the South.  He  was born on a Stringtown  Miss.  plantation and grew up in Greenville  Miss.  where  he  studied trombone and clarinet in high school before switching to saxophone. As a teenage musician   he  played in bands led by Elmore James  Ike Turner and Little Milton  among others.
Blues icon Muddy Waters heard  Shaw  playing in Itta Bena  Miss.  and urged  him  to come north to Chicago  which  Shaw  did in .
When  Shaw  got to the city   he  was stunned by the richness of the urban blues landscape.
âBack in the day  you could go to  or  blues clubs a night  all along Madison Street  Roosevelt Road   Street  King Drive (then South Park Way)   Street   Street â said  Shaw  in a  Tribune interview.
After playing for Waters   Shaw  joined the band of Howlinâ Wolf and also performed with Magic Sam  Freddie King  Otis Rush and others. But Wolf remained a guiding light for  Shaw   who backed him until Wolfâs death in .
 Shaw  continued to perform with various incarnations of Wolfâs band  the Wolf Gang  for the rest of  his  life.
âEvery show  he  did   he  dedicated a song to Wolf â said blues promoter Paul Benjamin. â He  wore a Howlinâ Wolf pin on  his  saxophone strap.â
But  Shaw  also forged a musical identity and recording career of  his  own.  He  won attention with  his  first single  âBlues for the West Side â in .  He  was prominently featured on Alligatorâs âLiving Chicago Blues  anthology in  and followed that with several albums of  his  own: âMovinâ and Groovinâ Manâ ()  âKing of the Roadâ () and âIn the Land of the Crossroadsâ ().

4322,test,"Debullshitifying Uber's  financial statement reveals a hemorrhaging fountain of red ink with no path to profitability
 Uber  trumpeted its / financial statements as evidence of the company's progress towards CEO Dara Khosrowshahi's goal of profitability and IPO by ; the company argued that despite losing $. billion in   its cust-cutting in the final quarter of the year was proof that they would eventually go from losing money on each ride to actually earning money.
But a closer examination of the figures shows that nothing of the sort is going on. The company's cost-cutting came mostly in the form of cuts to driver compensation  taking $. billion out of drivers' pockets  meaning that  Uber  drivers are increasingly losing money with every drive (something that isn't apparent until you factor in the capital costs borne by drivers).
 Uber  drivers can drive for other companies  or get other jobs (that's key to  Uber 's claim that  its  drivers aren't employees  without which the company would be unambiguously doomed); its rival Lyft is happy to go on paying drivers more (for now)  and drivers have already shown that it's pretty easy to ditch the platform  create their own app  and pocket % more than the company will pay them.
So  Uber 's already losing drivers  and also they lost $. billion -- and to become profitable  they'll have to find another $. billion in cost-cutting  which is unlikely to come from drivers  whom they're actually going to have to start paying more if they want to continue to have cars on the street.
For  Uber  to find an additional $./year in savings  there would have to be some indication that their costs were actually going down with scale. They're not. Insurance  a major cost to  Uber   is rising linearly with revenue. Other costs have gone down thanks to deep cuts: Operations  Sales and Marketing  Research and Development  and General and Administration. Unless the company starts spending more on these  they will not continue to grow  and thus will continue to lose billions.
What's more   Uber 's figures are totally untrustworthy. Every financial report from  Uber  picks a different set of accounting practices  selected to cast their dismal finances in the best possible light (and even with that cherry-picking   Uber  is still losing $./year!). So things are likely much  much worse.
All previous releases of  Uber  revenue data were limited to the top-line âGross passenger paymentsâ (the total money paid by passengers) and â Uber  revenueâ  the -% of that total retained by  Uber . In past analysis  I had assumed that the difference went almost entirely to drivers  but the newly released data shows this assumption is not true  and that  Uber  may be inflating the top-line revenue number. In   roughly $ billion of this revenue was âRefunds  Taxes and Feesâ or âRider Promotions.â Government charges and fares that are refunded should not have been included in the original gross revenue number. The âRider Promotionsâ item is more problematic. If  Uber  offered discounts  the higher fare (that the passenger did not pay) appears to be included in gross revenue  while the promotional discount is a separate offset. These numbers do not affect bottom line P&L calculations  but inflating the top-line gross revenue number directly supports Uberâs desire to show the strongest possible passenger demand numbers.  Uber  has steadfastly refused to release any numbers (such as market-specific fare and yield trends) that would meaningfully document whether (or where) its revenue performance might actually be improving.

4323,test,"For a brief moment  it looked like a journalist was about to pull off the impossible: leave  Nick Kyrgios  speechless.
Fresh from his breezy -  -  - win over Rogerio Dutra Silva in the first round of the Australian Open on Sunday   Kyrgios  answered questions about  his  form before getting surprised.
Reporter: Youâre friends with the American football player Colin Kaepernick and have been supportive of  him  in the past. What are your thoughts on  his  not being signed by an American football team this season?  Nick Kyrgios : I donât think Iâve ever spoken to that dude in my life. Reporter: But what are your thoughts about that? Kyrgios: Where does that question even come from? Weâre at the Australian Open  man. Are we done?
 Kyrgios  was left shaking  his  head and struggled to find the words â which prompted an awkward end to  his  media obligations.
Kaepernick â the former San Francisco  quarterback â is the catalyst for the national anthem kneeling movement that has since swept across the NFL  with many more players following  his  lead.
 Kyrgios  has not  even if  it  looked as if  he  did.  Kyrgios  took a knee before a Laver Cup match in September  though  he  later said it was a tribute to âimportant people that have passed away.â
 He  has tried remaining focused  and  his  win Sunday came with only one blemish as  he  told hecklers in the crowd to âshut the fâk upâ during the first set  leading to a terse exchange with the umpire  in which  he  told the official to do  his  job and keep the crowd silent.
But nothing was going to stop  Kyrgios  from demolishing Dutra Silva.  He  sent down  aces and smoked  winners in a one-sided contest that lasted less than  minutes.
Admitting  he  was battling nerves to start the match   Kyrgios  was overall pleased with  his  âpretty good performanceâ and has booked a second-round matchup with Serb Viktor Troicki  who defeated Australian Alex Bolt - (-)  -  -  -  - on Monday.
â He âs tricky.  He âs got a good serve and a great backhand â  Kyrgios  said.
â He âs a journeyman   he âs been on the tour a long time   he âs won a lot of matches and in grand slams  he âs made the fourth round a lot of times so  he  knows the ups and downs that come in a grand slam match.â","['For a brief moment  it looked like a journalist was about to pull off the impossible: leave  Nick Kyrgios  speechless.', 'Fresh from his breezy -  -  - win over Rogerio Dutra Silva in the first round of the Australian Open on Sunday   Kyrgios  answered questions about  his  form before getting surprised.', 'Reporter: Youâ\x80\x99re friends with the American football player Colin Kaepernick and have been supportive of  him  in the past.

4325,test,"SpaceX  plans to launch  its  Falcon Heavy rocket system on February  at : p.m. ET  though a lot could still change between now and then.
With some modifications   Musk  thinks the system could even become nearly as powerful as the most powerful rocket ever used to launch payloads  the Saturn V.
If SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launch on Tuesday is successful   Elon Musk  thinks the success will blow away the competition for launching heavy loads into space.
""If we are successful in this  it is game over for all the other heavy lift rockets  "" Musk  said on a press call Monday evening.
 Musk  believes if the Falcon Heavy can successfully get  its  very cool payload into space   it  will no longer make sense to use other vehicles certified for heavy lift launches  like the Delta IV Heavy  Russia's Proton  or Europe's Ariane . That's because of the same reason SpaceX's other rockets are already revolutionizing the business of getting to space â it's a lot cheaper to re-use the rocket boosters that propel something out of Earth's gravity well than to use new ones every time.
The Falcon Heavy isn't the only high-powered rocket SpaceX has in the works â the company is also working on the system known as the BFR  which it plans to certify for crewed missions.  Musk  said  it  is designed to be re-used more quickly than the Falcon Heavy.
If SpaceX wanted to make Falcon Heavy even more powerful   Musk  said  the company  could bring up the power pretty close to the Saturn V  the most powerful rocket in history. That's because Falcon Heavy essentially takes the Falcon  system  which SpaceX has now launched and landed quite a few times  and adds two identical first stage boosters (which provide most of the rocket's thrust) to the sides of the central booster  cranking up the power.
""We could dial it up to as much performance as anyone could ever want  we could add two more side boosters  make it Falcon Super Heavy  get upwards of  million pounds of thrust ""  Musk  said on the press call.
For now   it  appears unnecessary for SpaceX to make a rocket that powerful.  It  would need extra testing and provide more power than what planned future Falcon Heavy missions would require.
 It  still has to work
""It will be a real huge downer if it blows up  but if something goes wrong  hopefully it goes wrong far into the mission so we at least learn what goes wrong along the way ""  Musk  told Business Insider space correspondent Dave Mosher on the call. ""I'll just be happy if  it  clears the  pad and doesn't blow the pad to smithereens.""
If Falcon Heavy blows up the launchpad  it'll take between nine months and a year to rebuild it  said  Musk . There are still plenty of ways for  it  to fail once  it  gets off the ground â the whole structure could be torn apart by supersonic shockwaves or the side boosters may not separate  since that system has never been tested  for example â but at that point  SpaceX could probably launch another Falcon Heavy within a few months.
A successful flight would prove that at least the initial design works.  Musk  is hopeful.
""I'm sure we've done everything we could do to maximize the chance of success for this mission ""  he  said.
""It's either going to be an exciting success or an exciting failure â I'd say tune in "" said  Musk . ""It's going to be worth your time.""","['SpaceX  plans to launch  its  Falcon Heavy rocket system on February  at : p.m. ET  though a lot could still change between now and then.', 'With some modifications   Musk  thinks the system could even become nearly as powerful as the most powerful rocket ever used to launch payloads  the Saturn V.', ""If SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launch on Tuesday is successful   Elon Musk  thinks the success will blow away the competition for launching heavy loads into space."", '""If we are successful in this  it is game over for all the other heavy lift rockets  "" Musk  said on a press call Monday evening.', "" Musk  believes if the Falcon Heavy can successfully get  its  very cool payload into space   it  will no longer make sense to use other vehicles certified for heavy lift launches  like the Delta IV Heavy  Russia's Proton  or Europe's Ariane .

4328,test,"Benedict Allen  did not want to be rescued.
 Explorer Benedict Allen  tweeted a photo of  himself  before  he  left for Papa New Guinea last month. (Twitter photo)
 Allen 's goal  he explained on his blog  was to make contact again with the Yaifo  a tribe of people he had first encountered about  years ago in the central mountain range of the island country just north of Australia.
âNo outsider has made the journey to visit them since the rather perilous journey I made as a young man three decades ago â  Allen  wrote. âThis would make them the remotest people in Papua New Guinea  and one of the last people on the entire planet who are out-of-contact with our interconnected world.â
 Allen   now   couldn't resist the allure of trying to reach the Yaifo again to document how their lives may have changed and to see if some of them â including a young girl he had met named âFifiâ â would remember him.
 Allen  told  his  fans not to worry if they didn't hear from  him  until mid-November:  He  wouldn't be bringing a satellite phone or GPS device with  him .  He  would be going alone. And  he  had no plan for how  he  would return to âthe Outside World.â

4330,test,"With only three months to go before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's May  wedding at Windsor Castle  both the fashion and bridal worlds are abuzz with talk of who the bride will pick to design her dress and what kind of look she would go for.
While the design â as well as the designer â of the dress is a closely guarded secret  many are positive that  Markle  will choose a British designer.
Front-runners for  Markle 's choice include British-Canadian Erdem Moralioglu  known for his elegant  feminine styles; Ralph & Russo  the couture designers  Markle  chose for  her  engagement dress; heritage fashion powerhouse Burberry; as well as McQueen and Giles Deacon  who designed the wedding gown for Kate's sister Pippa Middleton.
""I mean  she could surprise us all and choose a Canadian brand â she was so loyal to them while she was filming up there "" said Miles Socha  editor-in-chief at Women's Wear Daily  referring to the time  Markle  spent in Toronto filming the TV series ""Suits."" ''But probably we would have to place our bets on a British designer.""
Some are hoping  Markle  will pick something less traditional because  she  has more leeway. After all  Harry is only fifth in line to the throne â and will be sixth after Kate  the Duchess of Cambridge  gives birth to her third child in April. In addition  their wedding venue  St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle  is less imposing than St. Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey in London.
Neoh hopes  Markle  will choose a dress that celebrates  her  individuality.
"" Meghan 's very different from the English tradition.  She 's got  her  career   she 's half-black ""  she  said. "" She 's not going to be queen. It has to be respectful and appropriate of course  but it can be a bit more exciting with the cut and the lines. I think maybe a high neck  low back â that'd be demure enough.""
 Markle  has already signaled a break from the conservative styles that dominate British royal wardrobes  ditching stuffy frock coats for sleek trousers. Many admired the sharp trouser suit  she  wore to match Harry's outfit at a recent official event.
Circumstances have changed since then â but whatever style she picks   Markle 's choice will soon be seen in bridal salons everywhere.

4331,test,"Story highlights Issac Bailey: I want to apologize for the hypocrisy of my region  the South  as many give  Roy Moore  allegations a pass
 He  says many conservative Christians pledge allegiance more to the GOP than to the church
Issac Bailey is an interim member of The Charlotte Observer editorial board and the James K. Batten Professor of Public Policy at Davidson College.  He  was a  Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow  him  on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are  his  own.
""Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter "" Alabama State Auditor Jim Zeigler told the Washington Examiner Thursday  in an attempt to defend  Roy Moore   a candidate for the US Senate from Alabama  after a damning story about  Moore 's alleged past was published by the Washington Post. ""They became parents of Jesus "" Zeigler added.
Such assertions of support are likely why a man like  Moore  felt comfortable enough to fund-raise just hours later -- while boldly proclaiming the name of God.
That's right. A man in a high-profile political race representing the supposed ""family values"" party  after being named in an eye-popping report alleging that when he was a -year-old man he tried to have a sexual relationship with a -year-old girl  not only did not drop out of the race or hide in shame  he doubled down.  Moore  denied the allegations and evoked the term ""spiritual warfare "" which is well known in Southern Christian churches  black and white  to elicit as much sympathy from the faithful as possible.
""The forces of evil will lie  cheat  steal -- even inflict physical harm -- if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me ""  Moore  pronounced in an email to supporters asking for emergency donations. ""Their goal is to frustrate and slow down our campaign's progress to help the Obama-Clinton Machine silence our conservative message. That's why I must be able to count on the help of God-fearing conservatives like you to stand with me at this critical moment.""","['Story highlights Issac Bailey: I want to apologize for the hypocrisy of my region  the South  as many give  Roy Moore  allegations a pass', ' He  says many conservative Christians pledge allegiance more to the GOP than to the church', 'Issac Bailey is an interim member of The Charlotte Observer editorial board and the James K.

Sethi said that the -minute broadcast version of  his  -minute pitch didn't accurately portray  him  or  his  company  and  he  explained that  he  doesn't regret refusing O'Leary's offer but wishes he had conducted his presentation differently.
To avoid meeting  Sethi 's valuation  O'Leary offered the $  as a loan at .% interest for  months in exchange for .% equity.  Sethi  looked wary.

Interestingly   Sethi  adamantly opposed partnering with O'Leary precisely because of his bully persona in the Tank.
""Going in I knew Kevin was not a great investor fit for our company ""  Sethi  said. ""A lot of people don't realize investment partnerships are about way more than money.

4333,test,"Republican Sen. Marco Rubio  told GOP leaders  he  would not vote for their tax bill unless the child tax credit is made more generous.
 Rubio  has also decried the drop in the top individual tax rate in the compromise bill.
Republicans can lose only two votes in the Senate to pass the bill â and with Bob Corker likely to oppose it   Rubio 's defection would leave them with no margin for error.
 Republican Sen. Marco Rubio  on Thursday said  he  would vote against the final GOP tax bill unless the child tax credit is made more generous.
"" Senator Rubio  has consistently communicated to the Senate tax negotiators that  his  vote on final passage would depend on whether the refundability of the child tax credit was increased in a meaningful way "" a representative for  Rubio  told Business Insider.
Before the Senate voted on its version of the tax bill  called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  earlier this month   Rubio  and Sen. Mike Lee introduced an amendment to make the credit deductible up to the payroll tax level. The move would have made the credit more generous for many low-income families  though it was defeated.
Republicans on Wednesday struck a deal on a compromise bill that reconciles differences in the House and Senate versions passed in those chambers. A representative for Lee said  the senator  had not made up  his  mind on the bill.
 Rubio  had been incensed when reports indicated the conference committee  tasked with coming up with the compromise bill  was nearing an agreement to make the corporate tax cut less generous and cut the individual tax rate for the wealthiest Americans.
 He  tweeted on Tuesday: "".% Corp. rate to pay for tax cut for working family making $ was anti-growth but % to cut tax for couples making $million is fine?""
If  Rubio  defects  the GOP would have no room for error in the Senate. Republicans control  seats  meaning the party can lose two votes to pass the bill  as Vice President Mike Pence would break a tie.","['Republican Sen.

So he has enjoyed postseason success as the right-hand man for Maddon  who is widely regarded as one of baseballâs best managers.
âItâs baffling to me a bit why  more often â  Maddon  told the Chicago Tribune during the Nationals-Cubs NLDS earlier this month. â He âs been around a lot of winning teams here  and not only that   him  as a player  thatâs what drew me to  him  a bit with the Rays.

Long served as hitting coach for the New York Yankees for eight seasons  which included winning the  World Series  before joining the Mets coaching staff in .

4340,test,"Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore  continues to face fallout after allegations that  he  had inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls surfaced last week.
The Republican National Committee pulled its funding from  the candidate  Tuesday after five women went on record to accuse  Moore  of sexual misconduct when  he  was in  his   and they were teenagers. One woman who claimed  Moore  inappropriately touched her said she was  at the time of the alleged assault.
 Moore  has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Members of the partyâs steering committee have not decided what action â if any â to take regarding  Moore    she  said. While itâs too late to remove  Mooreâs  name as the partyâs nominee from the ballot  Lathan could move to have  Moore âs election nullified with Alabamaâs secretary of state office.
Yanking the nomination would be a blow to members of the party who backed  Moore  and could cause a rift within the state GOP.
Steven Taylor  a political science professor and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Alabamaâs Troy University  noted to Fox News that stripping  Moore  of the nomination could also present legal issues and speculated that the party isnât willing to go that route.
Sen. Luther Strange  the Republican incumbent  wouldnât be popular enough to cumulate enough support  some Alabamans warn. Strange  who was backed by establishment Republicans and President Trump  lost the special election primary to  Moore  in September.
Another contender for a write-in candidate is Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- whose old seat  Moore  hopes to snag.
âI would be skeptical that enough of Roy Mooreâs supporters would show up and vote for a write-in â he said to Fox News.
But McConnell said Tuesday that âitâs safe to sayâ the process for expulsion in the Senate ethics committee would immediately begin if  Moore  is sworn in.
 Moore  wins  but  he âs shunned
Senators donât necessarily have to be promoted to a committee  so  his  colleagues could essentially shun  him  when  he âs there  Taylor said.
 Moore  wins  and becomes an active senator
 Moore  winning the election and becoming seated as a U.S. senator is the most âstraightforward option at this point â Muller said. He added that the question is whether this scandal can fade away over the next month or if it will continue to plague him.
âHe would really be disruptive in the Senate â Taylor said. âI really do wonder  if heâs going to be a pain in the rear end most of his time there  would Republicans just as soon have Jones and live with it. Jones is far more liberal than  Roy Moore  and would probably have a liberal voting record  but being from Alabama  youâd think heâd at least sometimes vote with Republicans.â

Hickey planned to speak later with  Benedict  to develop a steady flow of communication  adding  he  wouldnât interfere with development of pitchers in the minors.
Epstein said  Benedict  will spend time around the major-league team in spring training but the Cubs will take advantage of his expertise as a former scout and minor-league instructor as well.

4343,test,"David Krakauer  evolutionary geneticist  complexity theorist and CEO of the Santa Fe Institute (SFI)  takes the long view.
In our wide ranging conversation regarding where humanity might head (see the video here)   Krakauer  shared perspectives on brain scanning a billion people  ethical issues posed by technology such as free will and privacy  and even how ideas like the Calculus change us as a species. âIdeas change who we are in a fundamental sense. They change how we attain energy in the world  they change how we organize our societies  they change how we move. Without the Calculus  we wouldnât have rocket ships.â
 Krakauer  also discussed how the experience of being human might change this century as a result of technology.  He  started by looking back   years  and first considered what hasnât much changed. âIf you went back   years to ancient Sumer  youâd meet someone and say  âthis is a decent human being.â The timescale over which core human values change is very slow.â

 Abadi  ordered the offensive on Kirkuk and other Kurdish-held territory in retaliation to the Sept.  vote for independence in a referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) - a drive that was all but crushed by the surprise attack.
The -hour truce âshould allow a joint technical committee ... to work on the deployment of federal Iraqi forces in all disputed areas  including Fish-Khabur  and the international borderâ   Abadi  said in a statement.
 He  wants to take control of border crossings with neighboring countries  including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey  carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.
Speaking in Geneva on Thursday  Tillerson said he was âdisappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolutionâ and that he had encouraged  Abadi  to accept the KRG âovertures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitutionâ.
 Abadi  demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void  rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. âWe wonât accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution â  he  said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.","['BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered a -hour suspension to military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq  to allow for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with the Kurdistan region.', "" Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi  speaks with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (not pictured) in Baghdad  Iraq October   .

Macronâs office said the president spoke with Hallydayâs family after the news.  Hallyday  had long suffered from lung cancer and had repeated health scares recently that dominated national news.
 Hallyday âs glitzy stage aura was clearly fashioned around stars like Elvis Presley and  his  musical inspiration came from the likes of Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly. Yet  his  stardom largely ended at the French-speaking world.
Macron said âwe all have something of Johnny Hallyday in us.â Celine Dion was among stars sharing condolences.
The antithesis of a French hero right down to his Elvis-style glitter  his gravelly voice and his name with an un-French ring   Hallyday  was nevertheless an institution in France  with a postage stamp in  his  honor.
 He  was the top rock ânâ roll star through more than five decades and eight presidents. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy  as mayor of the rich enclave of Neuilly-sur-Seine on the western edge of Paris  presided in  over the entertainerâs marriage to his fourth wife  Laeticia.
Certainly among the most familiar faces â and voices â in France   Hallyday  was known simply as Johnny  pronounced with a slight French accent and lots of love by fans who spanned generations.
âFor each of us  he means something personal. Memories  happy moments  songs and music â Sarkozy said in December   days after  Hallyday   then   was hospitalized in Los Angeles. Sarkozy called the Hallyday family during an EU summit and giving updates on the singerâs condition during news conferences.
 Hallyday  sang some songs in English  including âHot Legsâ and âHouse of the Rising Sun â â the melody of which was also used for one of his most famous songs  the  âLe Penitencier.â
And there was a real American connection: American singer Lee Ketchman gave him his first electric guitar.  Hallyday âs stardom  however  was not inevitable.
 Hallyday  gave  his  first professional concert in   under the name Johnny  and put out  his  first album a year later. By    he  had met the woman who would be  his  wife for years  and remained  his  friend to the end  singing star Sylvie Vartan. That year   he  also made an album in Nashville  Tennessee  and rubbed shoulders with American singing greats.
With  his  square-jawed good looks and piercing blue eyes   Hallyday  was often sought-out for the cinema  playing in French director Jean-Luc Godardâs âDetectiveâ () and with other illustrious directors including Costa-Gavras.
More recently   Hallyday  appeared in Johnnie Toâs âVengeanceâ () and had talked about giving film a bigger role in  his  life.
However  it was the rockerâs sentimental life  and  his  marriage to Laeticia that gave  him  a mellow edge.  He  spoke lovingly of daughters Jade and Joy  who were adopted from Vietnam.
âIâm not a star. Iâm just a simple man â  he  said in a  interview on France .

4346,test,"Now  The Medicines Company CEO  Dr. Clive Meanwell   is preparing to jump into this very fray. But  he  does so with an unusual mindset.  Meanwellâs company  is developing inclisiran  a first-in-class  synthesis inhibitor with the potential to be at least as effective as Repatha and Praluent  maybe better. One major difference is that inclisiran only needs to be dosed once every six months  far less than the twice monthly dosing that the current agents employ. Thus  inclisiran has an obvious dosing/convenience advantages  as well as a cost-of-goods advantage over existing agents.
However  in a recent conversation   Meanwell  shared that  he  doesnât plan to compete solely on these benefits of inclisiran. Rather   he  plans to broaden access to inclisiran via a significantly lower price as compared to the established agents. Part of  his  move to this position was based on studying the changes in the top ten selling drugs of  vs. those of . The former group  which included drugs like Lipitor  Celebrex and Zoloft  generated sales of $ billion (inflation adjusted). The  list  which included Humira  Harvoni and Embrel  amassed $ billion. These data are not all that shocking. But what surprised  him  was that the $ billion spent in  benefited a target population of  million patients  whereas the top ten selling drugs of  only benefited  million. Basically  the top ten drugs of  are targeting one-eighth of the  population at . the cost.  He  believes that such a trend is unsustainable for healthcare in America.
So  what does  he  plan to do about it? Meanwell believes that inclisiran can be a very successful drug at a much lower price than Repatha and Praluent. Before dosing a single patient with inclisiran  The Medicines Company generated data to know exactly the type of profile the drug needed to have in order to be able to do this. Its phase  data from the ORION  study supports Meanwellâs view. Assuming this profile holds through the recently started phase  program  inclisiran would be positioned to be the  inhibitor for the masses â a drug priced so that anyone with documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and anyone who has already had a heart attack would have access to inclisiran.
Itâs unusual for a company to develop a first-in-class drug and then compete on price. In the past  companies have priced new drugs at a similar level that existing agents enjoyed. Mimicking such past practices  inclisiran on FDA approval would have been priced in the range that Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron have negotiated with payers. After all  inclisiranâs ultimate clinical profile will likely be similar to their drugs  so why not enjoy a similar price? Instead   Meanwell  plans to succeed by charging a much lower price thereby gaining greater payer acceptance and access to a much larger patient base. While not unprecedented  this is not a common practice.
 Meanwell  wasnât willing to give a specific price being contemplated for inclisiran.  He âll have a better idea on that once the phase  data for inclisiran begin to roll out. But  he  was quite confident that it would be significantly less than that for currently marketed  inhibitors  certainly low enough to get payers on board. In fact  The Medicines Company has already opened up a dialogue with payers to factor their views into these key decisions.
It will be a while before The Medicines Company gets to this crossroad as phase  has just begun. But this will be an important program to watch. If  Meanwell  is successful and inclisiran turns out to be a successful product   it  could change the drug pricing philosophy for the biopharmaceutical industry.","['Now  The Medicines Company CEO  Dr. Clive Meanwell   is preparing to jump into this very fray.

But  Maddon  flicks off criticism like dandruff on a tuxedo  insisting it's all part of baseball's rich pageant.  He  said  he  hasn't changed a thing since  he  started out  that changing lineups to utilize  his  bench and rest regulars is one of  his  trademarks.
""That's my whole managerial career ""  he  said. ""It's because we're not set up for (sticking with a regular lineup)  and because if you did  guys would be dead in the ground right now.""
 Maddon  will likely employ a more set lineup in the postseason  with the same four infielders and Willson Contreras behind the plate. The outfield rotation will depend on who's pitching and whether Jason Heyward sits against some left-handers  as  he  did in the  postseason.
No matter what  Maddon  decides when  he  sits in front of  his  iPad Pro and writes out the lineup   he  knows it probably will start a spirited debate.

4350,test,"A federal judge is allowing a wrongful arrest lawsuit to proceed against Fox Lake and other area law enforcement agencies that investigated the death of police Lt.  Charles Joseph Gliniewicz   whose staged suicide was portrayed for two months as the line-of-duty murder of a hero.
The three men who are suing claim they were unfairly targeted and detained as suspects when  Gliniewicz  was found shot to death in a remote area of the village after telling a radio dispatcher that he was pursuing three men on foot.
Authorities ultimately determined  Gliniewicz  took his life amid fears that his embezzlement of funds from the local youth police Explorer program was about to be exposed.
In his -page ruling  Guzman said the plaintiffs âset out facts sufficient to allegeâ that the massive manhunt âfor  Gliniewicz âs nonexistent killersâ resulted in part from the villageâs âfailure to supervise or disciplineâ the lieutenant before his death.
Two of the men whoâve sued â Raymond Willoughby and Damien Ward â say they were arrested the day of  Gliniewicz âs death  on Sept.   . Willoughby says in the suit that he was handcuffed  brought to a neighboring police station and held for several hours. Ward also says he was handcuffed and held for two hours and that officers tried to enter his home without a warrant.
In the same ruling this week  the judge dismissed Round Lake Park Police Chief George Filenko as a defendant in the lawsuit. Filenko was commander of the Lake County Major Crimes Task Force  which led the investigation into  Gliniewicz âs death. But Gregory E. Kulis  the attorney for the men who filed suit  said he would revise his complaints against Filenko in hopes of returning him as a defendant.
Willoughby  Ward and Cooper say they were targeted unfairly after  Gliniewicz  radioed in a vague description of three men he said he was pursuing  two white and one black.
A financial review of his management of a youth police training program was bearing down on him. The review later showed that  Gliniewicz  had taken thousands of dollars from the Explorers youth group and used the money for personal travel  loans  cash and adult websites.
But before those allegations became public   Joseph Gliniewicz   a heavily tattooed Army veteran known to many as âG.I. Joe â was portrayed as a selfless mentor and public servant. Thousands attended  Gliniewicz âs funeral.
Suspicions against him grew strong in October   when authorities found what they called âselectively deletedâ text messages indicating he was trying to cover up his financial malfeasance and considered harming the village administrator who was leading the probe of the youth groupâs budget. In addition  sophisticated ballistics tests showed that the muzzle of his gun had been shoved under his vest before  Gliniewicz  was shot  indicating it was unlikely someone other than  Gliniewicz  fired the shot.

 Luke Skywalker  was silent two years ago when audiences saw  him  in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. So now  he âs got plenty to say about a bunch of things  starting with a literal cliffhanger.
The new Star Wars: The Last Jedi (officially opening Friday  though theaters will show it Thursday night) opens as Force Awakens ended  with  old Luke (played by Mark Hamill)  being found on an island by young heroine Rey (Daisy Ridley)  who hands him his lightsaber from long ago. A dramatic scene  no doubt  and a visual pun that Hamill in retrospect adores.

Hamill    is living it up in the galaxy far  far away yet again  just as he did in George Lucasâ original trilogy that began in .  That Luke  was a farm boy with an eye for adventure alongside Harrison Fordâs Han Solo and Carrie Fisherâs Princess Leia â  this Luke  is a lot wiser  feeling responsible for mentoring young Ben Solo (Adam Driver)  who has turned to the dark side as Kylo Ren.
And when Rey shows up with some serious Force power   Luke  is worried yet again. âFor  him  to say itâs time for the Jedi to end  what could have happened that would put  him  in a place like that?â Hamill says.

Q: In playing  Luke  now  do you think of old Alec Guinnessâ Ben Kenobi from the first movie?
A: Absolutely  of course. That was  Luke âs major male role model â there was Uncle Owen  but he was a farmer  and I didnât want to be a farmer.
Q: Did you feel an ownership of  Luke  back then?
A: You have to have an audience eye. I remember having silly things happen  like on the Death Star (in the first Star Wars) when we were rescuing the princess. Han was really hitting on her â and it really bugged me! It was competitive the way Harrison and I were competitive for Carrieâs affections. I went over to George and said  ""I just donât think thatâs right."" He was reassuring me: âLook   Luke  doesnât care about that.  Luke  is completely focused on saving  her .â

4355,test,"When  Abu Fazel  listens to news of the civil war still raging in Syria   he  thinks about how  he  very nearly ended up a foot soldier there. But  Abu Fazel  isnât Syrian  nor was  he  ever a would-be Islamic State fighter.  He âs an -year-old Afghan refugee  living in the small city of Leverkusen  Germany.  He  spent most of  his  life in Iran but fled to Germany  rather than be sent to Syria by the Iranian government to fight on the side of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.
 Abu Fazel  is one of an unknown number of Afghan teenagers that have been recruited by Iran to fight in Syriaâs civil war over the past several years. Earlier this month  Human Rights Watch reported that it had identified the graves of eight Afghan children who had died in Syria  and collected evidence of other teenage recruits  some as young as . Conscripting children under the age of  as soldiers in active hostilities is a war crime  Human Rights Watch noted.
 Abu Fazel  was  years old when  he  was set to begin training for Syria.  He  and Ali  another -year-old Afghan refugee living in Germany  told The Intercept about Iranian militias targeting teenagers in immigrant neighborhoods.
âWe are cheap cannon fodder for them â said Ali  which is a pseudonym. The Intercept is also referring to  Abu Fazel  by only his first name because both youths fear retaliation against their families still living in Iran.
There are an estimated  million Afghan refugees in Iran  most of whom get by on black-market jobs and face racism and abuse  as well as scrutiny from the Iranian government. Afghan children often canât attend school. âAfghan  â Abu Fazel  said  is a common slur in Iran  and one  he  heard too often. âWe were second-class citizens â  he  said.

Abu Fazel  told The Intercept that members of both the IRGC and the Basij regularly visited  his  predominantly Afghan neighborhood in Tehran.  Abu Fazel  and Ali both said that  ironically  the war had in some ways improved conditions for Afghans in Iran  because the government has allowed more Afghan children to attend state schools with mixed classes and given out more residency permits as part of outreach to the communities.
âThey met young men in mosques and persuaded them to fight against ISIS or Al Qaeda â  Abu Fazel  said. âThey used to talk very softly to all of us. Many people  including myself  didnât even realize that we were trapped in their propaganda.â
The recruiters had managed to persuade Abu Fazelâs cousin  who was also a teenager at the time  to join the fighting in Syria. The cousin had become a member of the Liwa Fatemiyoun  an Afghan division whose alleged main purpose is the defense of the shrine of Zaynab  the Prophet Muhammadâs granddaughter  in southern Damascus. (Iranian state media has stated that there are about   Afghans fighting in the division.)
Eventually  in    Abu Fazel  decided to go to Syria as well. Then  that August  his cousin was killed while fighting Syrian rebels near Aleppo.  Abu Fazel  saw that the Iranian newspapers described  him  as a âmartyr â but one week before  his  own three-month-long training was supposed to start   Abu Fazel  decided to flee.

 Adams  and Herring offer Virginians a striking contrast in what the voters would get in their attorney general.
 Adams  stands in stark contrast to Herring. An officer in the U.S. Navy who later graduated from the elite University of Virginia School of Law   Adams  later served as a law clerk to Judge David Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit  then to Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court. Afterward  he served as associate White House counsel  then as a federal prosecutor.
 Adams  is campaigning on restoring the attorney general as a nonpolitical office  as the chief law enforcement officer of the Old Dominion who will vigorously enforce the laws of Virginia.  His  position is that if the people of Virginia want to change their laws  they must do so through the ballot box and their elected lawmakers  but that an attorney generalâs sworn duty is to defend those laws when challenged in court  even if the attorney general personally disagrees with the law. He is running on vigorously fighting violent crime and gang violence  combatting drug abuse and the opioid crisis  and safeguarding individual rights against government abuse.
 Adams  is an unapologetic constitutional conservative in the mold of Justice Thomas. Like most Supreme Court law clerks (an honor that only one lawyer in   ever receives)  he is well-respected as a brilliant legal mind who can quickly dive deeply into complex constitutional issues  including state sovereignty  criminal law  free speech  religious liberty  and the Second Amendment.
Virginians are divided over what sort of attorney general they want. The Old Dominion has trended more liberal in recent years with the massive growth of the federal government pouring into northern Virginia. But the incumbent Herring is clearly vulnerable.

 Horton  says  he  passed out in the Blackhawk and woke up a week later at what is now The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda  Maryland. Three toes had been pulverized   his  right ankle was broken  the calf muscle from ankle to knee was blown off  the artery to  his  leg was severed â  he  required  pints of blood â and  he  had hundreds of pieces of shrapnel in  his  body  many of which still remain today.
Also   he  wrote  ""my right elbow  wrist and three of my fingers were broken. My right eardrum had been blown out and I had suffered a severe concussion. I was later told that my brain had been bruised and had swollen. During surgery  I bled to death  my heart stopped beating  I stopped breathing  and had to be resuscitated. It took me two weeks to learn to stand  and several months to walk normally.""
But ""the worst part ""  he  told me  was feeling as if  he 'd abandoned  his  men  five of whom were killed after  he  came home.
""In my mind ""  he  said  ""I had left them and they died.""
It was while the injured Marine was unconscious and being flown to Bethesda that  his  wife was giving birth to those five babies at Edward Hospital. A little girl  Addyson  did not make it  and Horton  against the advice of doctors  he said  was released from the hospital so he could attend her funeral.
So far  the fund has generated close to half of its $  goal Bond hopes will not only offset the money the VA says  Horton  owes  but will help with the legal bills accumulated during the appeals process.
When he and another local Marine came to visit  Horton  around Christmas to give  him  the first disbursement of the fund  Bond said  Horton  made it perfectly clear  he  only wants this money to go to  his  children  and that any extra funds raised will go to help other wounded warriors needing assistance through the Semper Fi Fund.
 Horton 's issues with the VA came about after  he  and  his  wife divorced in .  He  says  he  filed the proper paperwork to let the agency know of  his  change in marital status  as  he  would be paid less as a single man. In   he  remarried and repeated the process   he  said  getting  his  new wife on the VA list.

Then in May of last year  Horton  received a VA letter stating  he 'd been overpaid since  and that  he  now owed almost $ . A large portion of  his  disability payments were being garnished until that debt was repaid.

 Manafort  and Gates  who allegedly failed to disclose the full extent of their work on behalf of the pro-Russian Ukrainian Party of Regions  are now being charged under the Foreign Agents Registration Act  a  era law aimed at curbing the influence of pro-German propaganda ahead of World War II.
âThe indictment of  Manafort  is sending shockwaves through K Street and the FARA Unit at the Department of Justice â said Craig Holman  a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen  a group that supports government transparency. âThe Justice Department largely neglected its role in the administration of FARA  which emboldened many lobbyists to ignore the law and opt to register under the weaker disclosure regime of the Lobbying Disclosure Act  if at all.â

Though it only refers to the firms as âCompany Aâ and âCompany B â news outlets have identified them as Mercury Public Affairs  a Republican heavy firm  and the Podesta Group  a Democratic lobbying powerhouse run by Tony Podesta  the brother of Hillary Clintonâs campaign chairman  John Podesta.

The billboard  displayed on the side of a moving truck Friday  reminded people of what Ivanka Trump  the presidentâs daughter and a White House adviser  had previously said about  Moore  amid accusations of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls.
Ivanka Trumpâs words contradicted her fatherâs unwavering support of  Moore . The president defended  Moore  last month  saying the former Alabama chief justice âtotally deniesâ the allegations against him and telling reporters at the White House that âyou have to listen to him  also.â
At his rally Friday  just four days before the Alabama special election  Trumpâs endorsement of  Moore  was even more unequivocal.

Trump also singled out one of  Mooreâs  accusers  Beverly Young Nelson  who had admitted earlier Friday that she added notes â a location  a date and the initials âD.A.â â to what she said was Mooreâs inscription to her in her yearbook. Nelson said she stands by her claim that  Moore  sexually assaulted her when she was a -year-old waitress in Gadsden  Ala.

Five women have told The Post that  Moore  pursued them when they were teenagers and  he  was an assistant district attorney in  his  .

4366,test,"One of the biggest wild cards in the  battle for the U.S. Senate may not be so wild after all.  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendezâs  federal corruption trial ended in a hung jury last week. That leaves  him  free to run for reelection in .  Menendez  could be retried  but many legal experts believe that a conviction is unlikely. Without that conviction  and absent major action following a Senate ethics investigation   Menendez  is a clear favorite in .
The case against an easy  Menendez  victory in the general election comes down to  his  current popularity â or lack thereof. An October Quinnipiac University survey put his approval rating at just  percent among New Jersey voters;  percent disapproved. Whether or not  Menendez  remains this unpopular following the lack of a conviction remains unclear. But any senator who has an approval rating of  percent should be in some danger of losing.
Yet  the Republicans who have emerged to challenge  Menendez  arenât likely to strike much fear in  his  campaign. None has more than about $  on-hand  according to the Federal Election Commission.  Menendez  has nearly $ million. Ousting an incumbent senator â even an unpopular one â with no money is â¦ difficult. Thatâs especially true for a Republican in blue New Jersey given how expensive New York and Philadelphia media markets are.
That  Menendez  is an incumbent also helps. The advantage of incumbency can vary by election  and  on average  itâs gotten smaller in recent years. But incumbents still usually do better than youâd expect given a stateâs fundamentals. In   for example   Menendez  won reelection by nearly  percentage points.  He  did so when the national political environment was much less friendly to Democrats than it looks to be in  â Democrats won the national House vote by  percentage point in . That is   Menendez  did about  points better than youâd expect a Democrat to do in New Jersey in .
 Menendez  probably wonât win by  points. The scandal will almost certainly hurt  him . Itâs just unlikely to hurt  him  by enough to give a Republican that good of a chance. A paper from Nicholas Chad Long estimated that Senate incumbents from  to  involved in scandals lost an average of . percentage points off their reelection margin. In such a scenario   Menendez  would still be forecasted to win by about  percentage points. Obviously  thereâs a margin of error surrounding this estimate  but it would take a pretty big error for  Menendez  to lose given these fundamentals.
So  Menendez   scandal notwithstanding  would be a general election favorite. There has  however  also been talk that a fellow Democrat might defeat him in the primary  before he ever gets to the general. Again  Iâm skeptical.
The most well-known potential challenger  former U.S. Sen. Bob Torricelli  announced on Thursday that he would not run. No Democratic challenger has raised any money with the FEC.  Menendez  has also locked down the endorsements of pretty much every major Democratic political player in the state  including the incoming Democratic governor  Phil Murphy.
Democrats looking to take on  Menendez  may also be warned off by the polling.  Menendez  is still moderately popular with Democratic voters. The aforementioned Quinnipiac survey had  his  approval rating with Democrats at  percent;  percent disapproved. And again keep in mind  this polling was conducted before the jury failed to convict  Menendez . It wouldnât be surprising if  his  approval rating rose now  especially if the  percent of Democrats who were undecided before the hung jury move into the approval column post-trial.
Of course  nothing in politics is certain. Despite his approval rating with Democrats  for instance  there was also a note of caution in that Quinnipiac poll: Asked whether  Menendez  deserved to be reelected   percent of Democrats said yes to  percent who said no.","['One of the biggest wild cards in the  battle for the U.S. Senate may not be so wild after all.

4369,test,"Supreme Court Justice  Neil Gorsuch  sparked an uproar this week by accepting an invitation to speak at a conservative event held at the Washington  DC-based Trump International Hotel  in which the president still holds a financial stake.
Dozens of protesters descended on the hotel Thursday ahead of  Gorsuch âs speech  carrying signs with messages like âGor$uch for saleâ and chanting  âWho is  Gorsuch ? Such a sellout â Politico reported.
Organizers of the event appeared baffled by the controversy  saying they had booked the hotel before Donald Trump was elected president and  Gorsuch  was nominated to the Supreme Court.
But ethics watchdogs  too  cried foul over the speech and questioned whether  Gorsuch âs appearance compromised  his  impartiality â particularly if certain lawsuits against Trump and his businesses eventually make their way to the Supreme Court.
 Gorsuch  in  his  speech did not address the criticisms  his  appearance had sparked  nor did  he  refer to Trumpâs ownership of the hotel  according to Politico. Instead   he  spoke about free-speech rights and civility.
âThose with whom we disagree vehemently still have the best interests of the country at heart â  Gorsuch  said. âWe have to learn not only to tolerate different points of view but to cherish the din of democracy â¦ Itâs not just about good manners and courtesy. Itâs about keeping our republic. â

4370,test,"Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.)  sought to defend  himself  against an accusation of sexual harassment Tuesday  saying  he  âdeveloped an affectionâ for a decades-younger staffer  he  considered  his  âsoul mateâ but never sought a romantic or sexual relationship with her.
 Meehan  settled with the former aide last year using taxpayer dollars after  she  filed a formal complaint of sexual harassment. The revelation of the settlement in a report by the New York Times on Saturday led to Meehanâs expulsion from the House Ethics Committee  which began investigating  his  behavior this week.
In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday  â Meehanâs  first lengthy response to the New York Times report â the four-term congressman denied engaging in harassment.  He  acknowledged lashing out when  he  learned the aide had started seriously dating someone outside  his  congressional office  attributing  his  reaction to the stress of a debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act.
âI started to talk to  her  about my reaction to  and you know  selfishly I was thinking about what this was going to mean to me â  he  told the Inquirer  adding that  he  âshould have been looking at it from the perspective of a subordinate and a superior.â
At the same time   he  said   he  sees  his  office as non-hierarchical. âWe call it  Team Meehan  â  he  said.
 Meehan  settled with the aide using funds from  his  office budget. While House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has called for  Meehan  to reimburse taxpayers for the amount   Meehan  told the Inquirer  he  would only do so if the Ethics Committee finds  he  did engage in harassment.
 He  said  he  told her  he  was âhappily marriedâ and ânot interested in a relationship  particularly not any sexual relationship.â
âBut we were soul mates â  he  said. âI think that the idea of soul mate is that sort of person that go through remarkable experiences together.â
The controversy has prompted calls from Democrats for  Meehan  to resign  his  seat representing Delaware County  where he already faced a tough reelection bid. As of Tuesday   Meehan  said  he  still planned to run in November.
The Inquirer published a partial image of a handwritten note  Meehan  sent to the aide last year to wish  her  well in  her  new relationship.
âYou are kind and sensitive and caring and infectious with your laugh â  he  wrote. âYou are and have been a complete partner to  me  and have brought me much happiness. It is a very  very lucky man who might get to be your partner for more of your life.â

(Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)
What we reported: In The Enquirer's special report  ""Seven Days of Heroin "" we met with  Stephanie Gaffney   the hopeful mother of an -month-old.
The phone on my desk in the newsroom rang that July morning with a call from a spokesman at Cincinnati Childrenâs Hospital Medical Center. âRemember that young mom with the baby you saw here at the NAS clinic? â
Stephanie Gaffney  was hard to forget.  She  was a spot of hope amid the devastation of the opioid epidemic in Greater Cincinnati  full of resolve at  to make life better for  her  daughter. Yes  I remembered her.
Just two weeks before  photojournalist Cara Owsley and I interviewed  Gaffney  at the special clinic for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome  an array of deficits and behaviors in those born affected by or dependent on opioids. Elliana was  months old that day.
 Gaffney  told us  she  had been sober  months  having gone cold turkey when  she  learned  she  was pregnant. Now that  she  had Elliana   Gaffney  aimed to graduate from rehab  get a job and marry fiancÃ© Stephen Russ.  She  wanted âas normal a life as addicts can have.â  She  saw the challenges ahead  but  she  sounded confident and full of possibility to give  her  daughter everything.
 Her  obituary said the service would be at Strawserâs Funeral Home in Blue Ash.  Gaffney âs bereaved mother Beth Arcail and stepfather Joe Arcail greeted visitors near the open casket. Then a tall  gaunt young man approached and bent over the body. âIâm sorry â he wailed. âIâm sorry. Iâm sorry. Iâm sorry.â
 Gaffney âs death presented a journalism challenge. Her clinic visit was an ingredient in The Enquirerâs special report  âSeven Days of Heroin â then in production. Her death occurred outside the projectâs one-week timeline  but we had to say something. We settled on one sentence: ""Ten days later   Gaffney  is dead from a heroin overdose.""

Ten days later   she  died of brain damage after an opioid overdose. (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)
 She  was recovering
After five years of fighting addiction   Gaffney  was broke.  She  had the liver infection hepatitis C and a criminal conviction for drug possession  with $  in fines yet to pay.  Her  record made job searching tough.  Her  family wasnât crazy about Stephen Russ   her  boyfriend from Erlanger. Beth Arcail sensed he was probably in a rehab program  too.
But life seemed to turn a corner with Elliana. Russ gave  Gaffney  an engagement ring on Motherâs Day  and the end of  her  formal drug treatment approached.
 She  had been at First Step Home  the Walnut Hills residential program for pregnant women and mothers with young children  since March . Margo Spence  executive director of the -year-old program  called  Gaffney  a role model for participants.  Gaffney  wrote a good-bye letter to heroin: ""This time  it's different. I don't ever want you again. I have something to work harder for this time around. It's not just my life anymore  it's mine and my daughter Elliana.""
By July    Gaffney  had earned the freedom of a First Step Home sober-living apartment with less structure and fewer restrictions.  Her  mother had misgivings. âI thought  she  needed more supervision until Elliana was a year old  but  she  wanted to move. What could I say?â
On July    Gaffney  and Elliana took two buses in a rainstorm from the new apartment to the appointment at the NAS clinic  where  Gaffney  held  her  wiggly daughter and talked to Owsley and me. Elliana was pronounced in good health and growing well.","['CLOSE In July  Stephanie Gaffney  told The Enquirer  she  was in treatment for  her  opioid addiction and aimed to create a good life for  her  child.

4373,test,"Horrific cuts cover her son's body after he's shot dead by Chicago police  and Cynthia Lane wants answers. A yearlong investigation by  CNN's Rosa Flores  shows the truth is not always black and white.
Chicago mom Cynthia Lane called CNN in  and  asked reporter Rosa Flores  to look into  her  sonâs death. That one phone call led to a yearlong investigation and the making of âBeneath The Skin.â
 Flores  and a team of producers consulted with forensic pathologists in Pennsylvania  Illinois and Missouri regarding some disturbing photos of Roshad McIntoshâs body. Flores and team obtained autopsy reports  autopsy photographs and investigative documents from the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook County. The spokeswoman for the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook County did not grant CNN an on-camera interview  but agreed to respond to questions by email and later by phone.
During  Flores â investigation  CNN interviewed two men who say they witnessed the shooting first hand. They did not want to show their faces on camera for fear of police retaliation and asked us to change the register of their voices.

4381,test,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) party nominated  ousted premier Nawaz Sharif  as its leader on Monday  a government minister said  hours before it used its parliamentary majority to amend a law to allow him to be re-elected party chief.
 Sharif  resigned as prime minister in July after the Supreme Court disqualified  him  for not declaring a source of income.  He  was also forced to step down as president of PML-N  though  he  kept control of the party and installed Shahid Khaqan Abbasi  a loyalist  as prime minister.
The partyâs state minister for interior  Talal Chaudhry  said a parliamentary meeting of the ruling party chaired by Abbasi had nominated  Sharif  as its leader. He said  Sharif  would be formally re-elected president in a session scheduled for Tuesday. âHe will become party president tomorrow  God willing â Chaudhry said.
Hours later  Pakistanâs parliament amended a law to enable  Sharif  to re-take PML-N leadership. The amendment bill was presented by law minister Zahid Hamid and passed by lower house with a majority.
âWe feel very strongly  Nawaz Sharif  has to lead our party.  He âs the symbol of unity in our party â said Rana Afzal Khan  a PML-N lawmaker.
Khan said  Sharif  was battling to assert âcivilian supremacyâ and boost democracy in a nation that has been beset by military interference in politics.
In protest some opposition lawmakers tore up paper copies of the Election Bill   passed by the Senate last week  that allows  Sharif  to become the party president again despite  his  disqualification by the court. But the vote was more of a formality as PML-N has a vast majority.
A previous election bill barred from office someone disqualified under Article  and  of the Constitution  which was used by the courts to remove  Sharif .
 Sharif  on Monday appeared before an anti-corruption court and is expected to be indicted next week  along with three of  his  children.
 The veteran leader  denies any wrongdoing and has alleged there was a conspiracy against  him   with senior PML-N figures pointing fingers at elements of Pakistanâs powerful military.
Relations between the military and civilian establishment were strained again on Monday when the paramilitary Rangers force  nominally under the control of the interior ministry  barred Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal from entering the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) courts where  Sharif  appeared.","['ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) party nominated  ousted premier Nawaz Sharif  as its leader on Monday  a government minister said  hours before it used its parliamentary majority to amend a law to allow him to be re-elected party chief.', ' Sharif  resigned as prime minister in July after the Supreme Court disqualified  him  for not declaring a source of income.

 Perez  said  he  mistakenly thought  he  became a U.S. citizen when  he  took an oath to protect the nation.  His  military superiors never offered to help  him  expedite  his  citizenship  Bergin reiterated in court Wednesday.
After his military service   Perez  sought treatment at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Maywood  where doctors diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder. He was supposed to return for more tests to determine whether he also had a traumatic brain injury.
In the meantime  he reconnected with a childhood friend who provided free drugs and alcohol. On Nov.     while with that friend   Perez  handed a laptop case containing cocaine to an undercover officer.  Perez  pleaded guilty to the drug charge and served half of a -year prison sentence.
While  Perez  was convicted of delivering less than  grams of cocaine  prosecutors have said  he  was arrested for delivering much more and received a reduced sentence after a plea deal. Prosecutors also pointed out that  Perez  was given a general discharge from the military after a drug infraction.
 Perez  said  he  discovered the citizenship oversight when  he  was summoned to immigration court shortly before  his  September  release from Hill Correctional Center in Galesburg. Instead of heading home to Chicago from prison   Perez  was placed in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and transferred to a Wisconsin detention center for immigrants awaiting deportation.

4384,test,"The -minute body-camera video was released shortly after former Officer Philip Mitchell Brailsford was acquitted Thursday on a murder charge in the January  shooting death of  Daniel Shaver of Granbury   Texas.
The release of the full video marks the first time the face-to-face encounter between officers and  Shaver  has been available to the public outside a courtroom. It was played at the beginning of Brailsford's trial in late October.
Officers ordered  Shaver  to lie down face-first in the hallway and not make any sudden movements or risk being shot.
At one point   Shaver  puts his hands behind his back.
""Please do not shoot me ""  Shaver  said  sobbing.
 He  was ordered to crawl toward officers. As  he  inched forward   he  reached toward the waistband of  his  shorts  leading Brailsford to open fire.  He  said  he  believed  Shaver  was grabbing a handgun to fatally shoot  him .
Authorities have said it looked as though  Shaver  was pulling up  his  loose-fitting basketball shorts that had fallen down as  he  crawled.
No gun was found on  Shaver 's body  but two pellet rifles related to  his  pest-control job were later found in  his  hotel room.
While the acquittal clears Brailsford of criminal liability   Shaver 's widow  Laney Sweet  and  Shaver 's parents have filed wrongful-death lawsuits against the suburban Phoenix city of Mesa.
Portions of the video had been released in May  after The Associated Press and other news organizations requested that it be unsealed.

In court filings  a prosecutor working with Special Counsel Robert Muellerâs team said  Manafort  was working on the article as recently as Nov. .
Had  it  been published  prosecutors say  it  would have violated a Nov.  court order not to discuss the case publicly.
The Russian colleague who was working with  Manafort  allegedly to shape public opinion about his work for a Ukrainian political party has ties to Russian intelligence agencies  according to the filing.
 Manafort  ultimately never published the opinion piece  after prosecutors reached out to  his  attorneys to alert them  they said in the filing.
Due to  Manafort âs actions  prosecutors said the judge should reject his request to modify his bail conditions.
 Manafort  has proposed an $. million bail package in exchange for lifting him from house arrest and electronic monitoring.
A spokesman for  Manafort  did not have any immediate comment.
 Manafort  and  his  business associate Rick Gates were both indicted in October in a -count indictment by a federal grand jury.

4387,test,"Until this point  there was an underlying faith in much of the political world that if  Robert S. Mueller IIIâs  investigation of Russian collusion in the election turned up unmistakably damning material about Donald Trump  Republicans in Congress would feel obligated by their commitment to the countryâs well-being to accept  Muellerâs  findings and challenge the president.

Well  it sure seems to be. Itâs not surprising that Trump and those on his payroll want to protect him at all costs. But we learned last week that Republicans are deepening their complicity in derailing Muellerâs investigation and burying the facts. The more  Mueller  imperils Trump  the more McCarthyite the GOP becomes.
The apotheosis of Republican congressional collusion with Trumpâs efforts to hang on at all costs came at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. One Republican after another attacked  Mueller  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as if the latter should be placed on a new compendium of subversive organizations.
The rationale for this GOP assault is that Peter Strzok  an FBI agent involved in the investigation  exchanged texts critical of Trump and favorable to Clinton with an FBI lawyer. Somehow   Mueller  got no props for removing Strzok from the investigation this summer.

4388,test,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) â Garrison Keillor  whose stories of small-town characters entertained legions of public radio listeners for  years on ""A Prairie Home Companion "" became another celebrity felled by allegations of workplace misconduct on Wednesday when Minnesota Public Radio terminated his contracts.
The homegrown humorist told The Associated Press he was fired over ""a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard.""  Keillor  didn't detail the allegation to AP  but he later told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he had put his hand on a woman's bare back when trying to console her.
""I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness  and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized ""  Keillor  told the newspaper in an email. ""I sent her an email of apology later  and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it.
MPR said only that it received allegations of ""inappropriate behavior"" against  Keillor  last month involving one person who worked with him during his time hosting ""A Prairie Home Companion.""  Keillor  retired as host of the radio variety show last year  but continued to work for MPR on various projects.
Later Wednesday   Keillor  gave a statement to MPR News saying he had to ""respect the privacy of the two employees who have made the allegations."" A spokeswoman for MPR's corporate arm didn't immediately respond to questions from AP on whether  Keillor  was accused of bad behavior with more than one person.
 Keillor 's hand-picked successor to host the show  mandolinist Chris Thile  tweeted Wednesday he was ""in shock"" after  Keillor 's firing. Thile had been a frequent musical guest on the show and said he knew nothing about the allegation  adding: ""I trust that the proper steps are being taken.""

Sue Scott  who worked on the show as a voice actor for  years with  Keillor   told the AP she was stunned. She said she saw no evidence of inappropriate behavior from  Keillor .
Fans also were shocked. Cindy Dina  of the Minneapolis suburb of Forest Lake  said she frequently listened when  Keillor  hosted the show and admired him  saying the Minnesota native was ""iconic.""
 Keillor 's storytelling earned him comparisons with Mark Twain and Will Rogers. His  best-selling book  ""Lake Wobegon Days "" landed him on the cover of Time magazine.
""A Prairie Home Companion"" was heard by nearly  million listeners a week on nearly  public radio stations across the U.S. the year before  Keillor  left as host. The inaugural show â attended by about a dozen people at Macalester College in St. Paul  Minnesota  on July    â is in the Library of Congress' national registry of historic sound recordings.
On Wednesday   Keillor  didn't say when the incident with the woman occurred. In his statement to AP   Keillor  said it was ""poetic irony to be knocked off the air by a story  having told so many of them  myself .

 His  separation from MPR came just days after  Keillor   an avowed Democrat  wrote a syndicated column that ridiculed the idea that Minnesota Sen. Al Franken should resign over allegations of sexual harassment.
MPR said it would rename the show now hosted by Thile and end distribution of ""The Writer's Almanac "" Keillor's daily reading of a poem and telling of literary events. MPR also plans to end rebroadcasts of ""The Best of A Prairie Home Companion"" hosted by  Keillor .

4392,test,"Democrat Doug Jones on Dec.  was projected to win Alabama's U.S. Senate special election  defeating  former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore . (Bastien Inzaurralde Alice Li/The Washington Post)
In one of the most remarkable upsets since  well  the presidential race last year  Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated Republican Roy Moore  who had been dogged by credible allegations of child sexual predation and openly declared his nostalgia for slavery  his bigotry toward Muslims and his wish to see homosexuality criminalized. Despite  Moore âs obvious  flagrant flaws  Jonesâs win stands as an impressive â even miraculous â victory in a state Donald Trump won by  points last year. Defying both right-wing pleas to preserve a Senate seat and the presidentâs personal endorsement of  Moore  (capped off by a rally Friday just over the border in Florida)  Alabama voters decided theyâd prefer not to perpetuate the stereotype of reactionary  racist Southerners.
Kudos to Jones  who ran a disciplined race  referencing but not exploiting  Mooreâs  alleged victims and positing an affirmative message for  his  state that included health care and education. Credit should also go to Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.)  whose last-minute declaration he had not voted for  Moore  may have swung some voters. In addition  an exceptionally high African American turnout ( percent of the electorate in early exit polls)  as well as overwhelming support among younger voters and a -point gender gap â very similar to the coalition that delivered big wins for Democrats in Virginia â made the difference. Certainly  the ultimate responsibility and credit for the defeat of  the odious Moore  goes to Alabama voters who decided enough was enough.
First  Trump  having been rebuffed twice by Alabama voters (after backing Luther Strange  who lost in the Republican primary  and then  Moore )  emerges a weakened  somewhat pathetic character. In a state he won with over  percent of the vote last year  his approval in exit polling was  percent  with disapproval at  percent. His party rebuked him on Obamacare repeal and now failed to carry his candidate over the finish line. In Alabama  of all places. With political impotence may come a Trumpian outburst â or string of outbursts â and a greater willingness among Republicans in the House and Senate to defy him. Itâs every man and women for him- or herself in .
Second  the defeat of  Moore  will intensify focus on Trump and his accusers as well as miscreants in Congress. With the resignations of Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.)  the tide had clearly turned in favor of credible accusers. Given the swift and fierce reaction in response to Trumpâs demeaning tweet virtually calling Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) a prostitute  watch for emboldened Democrats to demand an investigation of Trumpâs alleged sexual misconduct. That may well be a key issue in . The president may now have more to fear from female senators than from Robert S. Mueller III.
Third  the GOP is spared the ordeal of seating  Moore  in the Senate  but at the price of narrowing their margin to -to-. This makes passage of the tax bill that much dicier and puts Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine)  already under fire for support of the first version  in a precarious position. Does she swallow the phony spin and the bogus analyses or stand firm in support of the Obamacare exchanges and fiscal prudence? (FamiliesUSA put out another analysis debunking her claim that two legislative fixes make up for repeal of the individual mandate.) Expect the onslaught against Collins to intensify.","[""Democrat Doug Jones on Dec.  was projected to win Alabama's U.S. Senate special election  defeating  former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore .

4393,test,"Lee Harvey Oswald  suspected assassin of U.S. President John F. Kennedy  holds up his manacled hands at police headquarters in Dallas  where he is held for questioning  on Nov.   . (AP)
Ruth Paine  a quiet Quaker  returned home from the grocery store. On her front lawn  there was her tenant Marina Oswald  playing with her daughter Junie. And there was Marinaâs volatile  semi-estranged husband   Lee .
Wait   Lee ?
âI was surprised to see  him  â Paine would say later.
 Lee  â  Lee  Oswald  middle name Harvey â learned the language in the Soviet Union  where he had moved after his service in the U.S. Marines. Thatâs where he met Marina  who was now living with Paine  teaching her Russian. Oswald    an odd and boorish man  stayed downtown in a rooming house. He came by only on the weekends.
Lee Harvey Oswald just missed an Army general in an attempted assassination months before JFK was killed. James Swanson  author of ""End of Days"" explains. (The Washington Post)
 Lee  was lying on  his  stomach with  his  eyes closed when she crept into bed. Marina still had pregnancy privileges; that is  she was allowed to sleep with her feet on whatever part of his anatomy they came to rest. About three in the morning  she thinks  she put a foot on his leg.  Lee  was not asleep and suddenly  with a sort of wordless vehemence   he  lifted  his  leg  shoved her foot hard  then pulled  his  leg away. âMy   he âs in a mean mood â Marina thought.
 Oswald  woke up late.  He  told Marina there was money on the dresser. Without her noticing   he  slipped off  his  wedding ring and left it in a cup.  He  did not kiss her goodbye. Marina went back to sleep.  Kennedy âs plane landed at Love Field a couple of hours later.

By then  Oswald was at the Book Depository but not for work. Marina and her landlord kept the TV on  dipping in and out of the coverage of  Kennedy âs visit. Around : p.m.  the first bulletin came in:  The president  had been shot. Thomas Mallon  in his book âMrs. Paineâs Garage â recounted the strange calmness â and then terror â in the home Marina shared with the Quaker:
Even now  entering the limbo hour that  Kennedy  lay in Parkland Hospital  the maternal workday went on. Marina stepped into the backyard to hang laundry. (Paine) soon joined her there with further news from the television: The shots fired at the motorcade were not thought to have come from the Texas School Book Depository.  Lee   presumably  would have quite a story to tell when  he  arrived back here tonight.
Marina and Paine sat down in front of the TV. When word came that  Kennedy  was dead  Paine began to cry. Marina did not. âDespite her trip to the garage â Mallon wrote  she âhad not shed all fears that her violent  assassination-prone husband might yet prove involved with this catastrophe.â
They were looking for Oswald. They didnât have a warrant. They appeared highly agitated and serious. They asked whether Oswald owned a gun. Paine said no. She translated the question to Marina  who said yes. Paine was aghast. âNo mention had yet been made of  John Kennedy  â Mallon wrote  but Paine ânow understood what this was really about.â
âThat was when I had this feeling â Paine told Mallon. â âMy God  it could have been  Lee .â That  he  came out last night  that the gun had been there â¦â

The Hill reported Friday that  Bloom  worked with campaign donors and tabloid media outlets to arrange compensation for the alleged victims and a commission for  herself   offering to sell their stories. In one case   Bloom  reportedly arranged for a donor to pay off one Trump accuserâs mortgage and attempted to score a six-figure payment for another woman. The former ultimately declined to come forward after being offered $   the clients told The Hill.
âI consider myself lucky to have had  Lisa Bloom  by my side after my old lawsuit resurfaced."" - Jill Harth  accused President Trump of groping  her 
The Hill cited contract documents  emails and text messages it obtained -- including an exchange of texts between one woman and  Bloom  that referred to pro-Hillary Clinton political action committees.
 Bloom   who is the daughter of famous attorney Gloria Allred and  like her mother  specializes in representing women in sexual harassment cases  worked for four women who were considering accusing Trump. Two went public  and two declined.
 Bloom  did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News.
In a statement to The Hill   Bloom  acknowledged trying to get  her  clients paid  but said the payments were to help the women stay safe  and in some cases relocate.
âDonors reached out to my firm directly to help some of the women I represented â  Bloom  said.
 Bloom  told The Hill  she  had no contact with Clinton or her campaign.
The Hill spoke to makeup artist Jill Harth  who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Trump in   accusing him of pushing  her  up against a wall at his Mar-a-Lago estate and groping  her . Although  she  withdrew the suit  nearly  years later  the litigation resurfaced during the presidential campaign and Harth was thrust into the spotlight.  She  asked  Bloom  to represent  her  after Trump denied  her  accusations.
âI consider  myself  lucky to have had  Lisa Bloom  by my side after my old lawsuit resurfaced.  She  advised me with great competence and compassion â Harth told The Hill.
 Bloom  arranged payment from the licensing of some photos Harth had to the news media  and then helped set up a GoFundMe.com account to raise money for Harth  The Hill reported.
âJill put herself out there  facing off with Donald Trump â Bloomâs husband wrote in a fund-raising appeal  according to The Hill. âLetâs show  her  some loveâ
 Bloom  also reportedly arranged for a Clinton donor to help Harth pay off the mortgage on her Queens apartment. The amount was less than $   according to a source directly familiar with Harthâs situation.

4398,test,"President Donald Trump tweeted Monday morning that ""we need "" Roy Moore  to win the Alabama Senate race.
Recent polling suggests many Alabama Republicans do not believe the allegations against  Moore   who has been accused of sexual misconduct.
The race is close  with  Moore  tied with or slightly ahead of  his  Democratic rival in polls.
President Donald Trump on Monday morning tweeted support for  Roy Moore   the US Senate candidate in Alabama who stands accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers.
""Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need  Republican Roy Moore  to win in Alabama "" Trump tweeted. ""We need  his  vote on stopping crime  illegal immigration  Border Wall  Military  Pro Life  V.A.  Judges  Amendment and more.""
Trump also spoke out against  Moore 's Democratic rival  Doug Jones  calling Jones a ""puppet"" of the Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.
While Trump will not go to Alabama to campaign for  Moore   on Friday he has a rally scheduled in Pensacola  Florida  which sits just outside Alabama's border and shares a media market with a significant portion of the state.
Trump's Monday-morning tweets follow a de facto endorsement he gave  Moore  in November. It comes after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walked back his stance on  Moore .
McConnell  who previously asked  Moore  to step aside  told ABC's ""This Week"" that  he  was going to ""let the people of Alabama make the call"" on whether  Moore  should serve.
A CBS poll on Sunday found  Moore  leading Jones by  points  but another poll found the two in a tie. The CBS poll also found % of Republicans in Alabama didn't believe the allegations of sexual misconduct against  Moore .

4400,test,"Beverly Young Nelson confirmed she added ""notes"" to an inscription she said  Roy Moore  wrote in her yearbook decades ago.
Nelson has accused  Moore   a Republican Senate candidate in Alabama  of sexually assaulting her in his car in the late  when she was .
 Moore  and  his  attorneys have previously suggested the yearbook inscription was a forgery.
Beverly Young Nelson  who has accused the Alabama Republican  Roy Moore  of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager  confirmed to ABC News that she wrote ""notes"" underneath an inscription she said  Moore  signed in her yearbook decades ago.
She also confirmed at Llamas' request that  Moore  ""did sign it."" Llamas did not further question Nelson on the inscription in the footage of the interview that ABC News aired.
Nelson detailed allegations against Moore  who's running for a US Senate seat in Alabama's special election on Tuesday  in a November press conference with the high-profile attorney Gloria Allred. Nelson is one of several women who have accused  Moore  of varying degrees of sexual misconduct.
Nelson said she knew  Moore  when she was a -year-old waitress at an Alabama restaurant in the late  and accused  him  of groping her in  his  car after offering her a ride home.
To back up her assertion that  Moore  knew her  Nelson presented a message in her yearbook that she said  Moore  wrote.
The message said: ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say 'Merry Christmas.' Love  Roy Moore D.A.  --  Olde Hickory House.""
 Moore  and  his  attorneys quickly sought to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the inscription  demanding that an expert in handwriting analysis examine it.
At a press conference days after Nelson's   Moore 's attorneys said the date and restaurant name underneath  Moore 's signature appeared not to match other samples of  Moore 's handwriting. They also seized on the ""D.A."" abbreviation  implying that Nelson had lifted the letters from a court filings stamp belonging to a person with those initials.
Allred initially declined to answer reporters' questions about whether Nelson's yearbook message was a forgery. After the  Moore  campaign's press conference   she  told CNN's Wolf Blitzer  she  would welcome an expert analysis of the message so long as it took place in a Senate hearing.
At another press conference Friday afternoon  Allred cited a Georgia-based handwriting expert  Arthur Anthony  who studied several samples of  Moore 's handwriting and said he believed the signature in Nelson's yearbook was  Moore 's.
""We think it's important evidence that supports Beverly statements that  Roy Moore  asked to sign  her  yearbook when  she  was just  years old "" Allred said at the press conference  AL.com reported. ""And it demonstrates that when  Roy Moore  stated 'I do not know any of these women ' that statement does not appear to be true.""
""Since I spoke about my experience with  Roy Moore  when I was only  years old  I have been the target of threats and lies "" Nelson said at the press conference.

4401,test,"But the first responders were  hours late.  James Dolan   a -year-old former Marine and computer security expert  had hanged  himself  in  his  room two days before  on Dec.   according to the NYPD.
The answer may never be known. What is known is  Dolan  was the second member of a small team of brilliant Internet activists who developed SecureDrop â a whistle-blower submission system â to commit suicide by hanging in Brooklyn.
There were no such blunt pronouncements at  James Dolanâs  New York funeral earlier this month â even if his closest friends and family might have felt the same way. Like Swartz   Dolan  was a digital activist  working to help non-profits and reporters expose government corruption without putting their lives at risk. But unlike Swartz   Dolan  did everything to make himself invisible. In an age dominated by social media  the computer security expert and Iraq war veteran had virtually no online presence.
Yet  shortly after his death was announced in a blog post earlier this month  the Internet lit up with questions  hinting at conspiracies. WikiLeaks noted in a tweet: âSecond developer of WikiLeaks inspired submission system âSecureDropâ security expert James Dolan  aged   has tragically died. He is said to have committed suicide. The first  Aaron Swartz  is said to have taken his own life at age   after being persecuted by US prosecutors.â
On Jan.   days after Dolanâs suicide was announced publicly  one Twitter user mused  âBoth  James Dolan  and Aaron Swartz who were working on the whistle-blowing tool committed suicide . . . weâre supposed to believe that . . . I donât freakinâ think so!!!!â
One of  Dolanâs  associates dismissed the online chatter as âtotally unfounded and false conspiracies â adding that  Dolan  never had anything to do with WikiLeaks. Other sources told The Post that  Dolan  suffered from depression linked to post-traumatic stress disorder  which set in after  he  returned from  his  second tour of duty in Iraq in March .

President Donald Trump on Tuesday implicitly endorsed  Roy Moore  the Republican Senate nominee in Alabama   telling reporters as  he  left the White House for a Thanksgiving trip to Palm Beach  Florida  ""We don't need a liberal person ... a Democrat "" in that seat.
In the past two weeks   Moore  has been accused of sexual misconduct by several women  including one who told The Washington Post that  he  initiated a sexual encounter with  her  in   when  she  was  and  he  was in .

 The president  also said the recent wave in the US of women coming forward to share their stories of being sexually harassed or assaulted by powerful men was a good thing for society.
Trump  who has characterized allegations of sexual misconduct brought against  him  by more than a dozen women during last year's presidential campaign as lies  had not previously addressed those against  Moore .

Rose    whose show airs on PBS and Bloomberg TV  also co-hosts âCBS This Morningâ and is a contributing correspondent for â Minutes.â
There are striking commonalities in the accounts of the women  each of whom described their interactions with  Rose  in multiple interviews with The Post.

Within hours of the publication of this article  PBS and Bloomberg LP immediately suspended distribution of the âCharlie Roseâ show. CBS announced that it was suspending  Rose  as it looked into the matter.
Most of the women said  Rose  alternated between fury and flattery in his interactions with them. Five described  Rose  putting his hand on their legs  sometimes their upper thigh  in what they perceived as a test to gauge their reactions. Two said that while they were working for  Rose  at his residences or were traveling with him on business  he emerged from the shower and walked naked in front of them.

Breathe. Taking deep breaths can be centering and remind a person to zero in on the here and now. âSometimes when our traumas get triggered  our thinking goes back to the past â  she  said. Focusing on inhaling slowly and deepening the breath can bring the mind back to the present.

4414,test,"An Upset In Trump Country: Democrat Doug Jones Bests Roy Moore In Alabama
Democrat Doug Jones has won the Alabama Senate special election  a victory that was a stunning upset in a deeply red state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump.  The president  who had backed Republican Roy Moore despite multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and assault   congratulated Jones on Twitter.
The win by Jones  projected by The Associated Press two hours after the polls closed Tuesday night  is sure to send shock waves through Washington. The special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions  who left the Senate in February  was upended in November as multiple women came forward to say  Moore  had pursued them romantically as teenagers when  he  was in  his  . Some alleged  he  had sexually assaulted them  including one woman who said  he  had initiated sexual contact with  her  when  she  was just .  Moore  has denied the accusations.
The president had come to  Moore 's defense  casting doubt on the women's allegations â much as he has done with the multiple women who have accused him of sexual assault. While Trump didn't campaign with  Moore   he did hold a rally just across the border from Alabama in Pensacola  Fla.  on Friday evening and recorded a robocall on his behalf  urging voters to choose  Moore  because  he  would support  his  agenda in the Senate. And after Trump reaffirmed his endorsement for  Moore  last week  the Republican National Committee reinstated its financial support for the GOP nominee after having pulled it following the accusations.
 Moore  refused to concede Tuesday night  saying that  his  campaign would ""wait on God and let this process play out.""  He  pointed to the uncertain write-in totals  he  believed could still change the outcome and trigger a recount. However  there has to be a difference of . percent or less between the two candidates to trigger an automatic recount  and with almost all the votes in  Jones' margin of victory was about three times that.
""The problem with this campaign is we've been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light  "" Moore  said to a dwindling group of supporters Tuesday night.
Democrats were quick to point to the reversal by the RNC to renew support for  Moore  and indicated they would use it as fodder heading into the  campaign.
""Today  in one of the most Republican states in the nation  the people of Alabama chose common decency and integrity over partisan politics "" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen  D-Md.  said in a statement. ""Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee did the opposite  siding with a candidate who wanted to drag Alabama back to the days of George Wallace and faced a mountain of credible evidence that he had engaged in child sexual abuse. ... President Trump  Republican Senate candidates and the Republican National Committee showed us exactly who they are by standing with Roy Moore â and we will make sure voters do not forget it.""
Other national Republicans had been far less hospitable. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he believes  Moore 's accusers and called on him to step aside  though he had softened his stance in recent weeks by saying the choice was up to Alabama voters. A Senate ethics investigation into the sexual assault allegations against  Moore  likely also would have followed had  he  won.
McConnell's allied superPAC  the Senate Leadership Fund  had spent heavily to support appointed Sen. Luther Strange in the primary  fearful that a  Moore  win would put the seat in jeopardy even before the sexual assault allegations against  him  surfaced.
Trump had backed Strange then  too  but Steve Bannon â his former chief strategist who has since returned to lead Breitbart News â supported  Moore  and rallied with  him  in the closing days. Bannon had long touted  Moore  as part of the ""war"" he had promised to wage on the GOP establishment  backing challengers to sitting incumbents who would take on McConnell and support Trump's agenda. But other national strategists warned Bannon's civil war would cost them winnable seats â something that came to fruition on Tuesday night.
National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner  R-Colo.  who is in charge of protecting the GOP's Senate majority in   had withdrawn funding from  Moore 's campaign and at one point said he should be expelled from the Senate if he won.
""Tonight's results are clear  â the people of Alabama deemed Roy Moore  unfit to serve in the U.S. Senate "" Gardner said in a statement soon after Jones was declared the winner. ""I hope Senator-elect Doug Jones will do the right thing and truly represent Alabama by choosing to vote with the Senate Republican Majority.""
Even the state's senior GOP senator  Richard Shelby  had admitted he didn't vote for  Moore   saying ""the Republican Party can do better"" and revealing he had instead written in another candidate. That may have pushed other on-the-fence Republicans to also write in a candidate  and that margin could have helped ultimately tip the race in Jones' favor.
In the end  Republicans recognize that they may be better off without having to deal with  Moore  in their caucus.
""It may well be the best possible outcome. We don't have to apologize for  Moore and Jones  will win with less than % of the vote and will quickly fade into  "" Barry Bennett  a former Trump campaign adviser  told NPR. ""This race wasn't about anybody other than  Roy Moore  and  his  past.

4416,test,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodiaâs main opposition party has given up hope of escaping a ban when the Supreme Court rules on Thursday on a suit brought by  the government of authoritarian leader Hun Sen   a senior leader said.
 The government  called for the ban after arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha on Sept.  and charging him with treason for an alleged plot to take over the Southeast Asian country with help from the United States.
Hun Senâs opponents say the charges are politically motivated to eliminate Kem Sokha from next yearâs election so the strongman  who is currently the worldâs longest serving prime minister  can extend his more than  years in power.
The judge who heads the Supreme Court  Dith Munty  is a member of the permanent committee of the ruling Cambodia Peopleâs Party (CPP) and a longtime  Hun Sen  loyalist.
 Hun Sen   a former Khmer Rouge commander  has held power since  by intimidating and dividing  his  enemies and through legal proceedings that have occasionally led to political bans on rivals at critical moments.
Next yearâs election was shaping as possibly the biggest challenge to  Hun Senâs  leadership  after  his  opponents unified behind the CNRP.
 The veteran opponent of Hun Sen  said the party would be dissolved anyway so  his  membership now made no difference.
â He  is not mature.  He  has no political philosophy and doctrine  but only anger and hatred â Huy Vannak  undersecretary of state at the Interior Ministry  told Reuters.  He  also noted that the CNRP had not defended its position in court.
 Hun Sen  has brushed off Western criticism  though  he  also lauded Trump as a kindred spirit this week and urged  him  to rein in subordinates critical of Cambodia.  Hun Sen  is also increasingly close to China  Cambodiaâs biggest donor.","['PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodiaâ\x80\x99s main opposition party has given up hope of escaping a ban when the Supreme Court rules on Thursday on a suit brought by  the government of authoritarian leader Hun Sen   a senior leader said.', ' The government  called for the ban after arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha on Sept.  and charging him with treason for an alleged plot to take over the Southeast Asian country with help from the United States.', 'Hun Senâ\x80\x99s opponents say the charges are politically motivated to eliminate Kem Sokha from next yearâ\x80\x99s election so the strongman  who is currently the worldâ\x80\x99s longest serving prime minister  can extend his more than  years in power.', 'The judge who heads the Supreme Court  Dith Munty  is a member of the permanent committee of the ruling Cambodia Peopleâ\x80\x99s Party (CPP) and a longtime  Hun Sen  loyalist.', ' Hun Sen   a former Khmer Rouge commander  has held power since  by intimidating and dividing  his  enemies and through legal proceedings that have occasionally led to political bans on rivals at critical moments.', 'Next yearâ\x80\x99s election was shaping as possibly the biggest challenge to  Hun Senâ\x80\x99s  leadership  after  his  opponents unified behind the CNRP.', ' The veteran opponent of Hun Sen  said the party would be dissolved anyway so  his  membership now made no difference.', 'â\x80\x9c He  is not mature.

To recap: Uber investors Benchmark  the venture capital firm  and Travis Kalanick  the former CEO and co-founder  are locked in a boardroom brawl and court battle over control of the company.  Pishevar   an early Uber investor  and ally of Kalanick inserted  himself  in that battle last week when  he  filed to intervene in the case and represent an ""Uber Shareholder Alliance.""
On Wednesday  Pishevar's representatives sent Forbes a statement  he  wrote the night before filing. It's unclear why it is being released a week after the fact  but the two sides of the case are in court on Wednesday in Delaware where a judge is deciding on whether or not the case should be sent to arbitration.

4421,test,"The new movie Call Me By Your Name is based on a beloved novel of the same title by AndrÃ© Aciman. It tells the story of two young American men who fall in love one summer in Northern Italy. Elio    is played by TimothÃ©e Chalamet (Lady Bird)  and Oliver    is played by Armie Hammer (The Social Network  The Lone Ranger).
When we meet  Oliver    he 's all appetite and momentum â crushing soft-boiled eggs  throwing back glasses of fresh apricot juice and sleeping through dinner. But Hammer says the character is more complicated than he seems at first.
"" He  is very brashly American in a lot of ways  and then in other ways  he 's using that as a cover to cover an amount of discomfort and self-unassuredness and all of that. So  he 's complicated  which  as an actor  makes  him  more interesting to play.""
But so much of that scene was about watching someone be totally enraptured and just lost in a moment and enjoying themselves  because that's one of the things that  Oliver  is able to do that Elio really appreciates.
On how  Oliver  displays  his  Jewishness  but covers  his  love of Elio
You know  there's that line in the movie  and also in AndrÃ© Aciman's novel  where they refer to themselves as ""Jews of discretion."" And I think  you know   Oliver  wears  his  Judaism on  his  sleeve  and on  his  neck  more because  he  wears  his  Star of David  which is funny and ironic because there are other things about  him  that  he  does hide and that  he  cannot put out there  like the fact that  he  is  in fact  in love with Elio.
On whether  he 's ever had a summer like the one in the film â a summer  he  never wanted to end
I do feel fortunate that the way our relationship in the movie unfurls has very little to do with power dynamics. If anything  it really is Elio  the younger one  who has to be the one who is bold enough to say  ""Oliver  this is how I feel. This is what I'm going through."" And so it's â there's less of that power dynamic in our relationship  which I'm thrilled about because it's just two people consensually falling in love with each other.
ARMIE HAMMER: (As  Oliver)  What does one do around here?
HAMMER: (As Oliver) Yeah. And what do you do in the winter  wait for summer to come?
HAMMER: (As Oliver) Christmas - I thought you were Jewish.
SHAPIRO: Elio is . He's played by the relative newcomer Timothee Chalamet.  Oliver  is .  He 's played by Armie Hammer  who's best known for  his  roles in ""The Social Network "" ""The Lone Ranger"" and other big-budget films. When we meet  Oliver    he 's all appetite and momentum  crushing soft-boiled eggs  throwing back glasses of fresh apricot juice  sleeping through dinner. Hammer told me the character is more complicated than he seems at first.
HAMMER:  He  is very brashly American in a lot of ways. And then in other ways   he 's using that as a cover to cover an amount of discomfort and self-unassuredness (ph) and all of that  so  he 's complicated  which  as an actor  makes  him  more interesting to play.
HAMMER: (As Oliver) I'm from a small town in New England. I know what it's like to be the odd Jew out.
HAMMER: Right. Yeah. You know  there's a - there's that line in the movie and also in Andre Aciman's novel where they refer to themselves as Jews of discretion. And I think  you know   Oliver - Oliver  wears  his  Judaism on  his  sleeve and - or on  his  neck more because  he  wears  his  Star of David and - which is funny and ironic because there are other things about  him  that  he  does hide and that  he  cannot put out there  like the fact that  he  is in fact in love with Elio.
HAMMER: Yeah. We actually talked about that quite a bit. If this would have taken place later  we don't think that this relationship would have ever happened. We don't think that they would have ever made that connection because  Oliver  would have come but  you know  Elio would've been busy on Instagram or Twitter and been talking to his friends. And he would have - he would have found busy stuff to keep him  you know  away from this whole thing evolving and developing.

4427,test,"The settlement comes after a Cook County jury in August deliberated just four hours before awarding Tierney Darden  now   a record $ million in damages. The city had admitted it was liable five months before trial. Jurors lined up to hug Darden  who lives with her father in Vernon Hills  before leaving the Daley Center courtroom.
After the city argued in court the verdict was âexcessiveâ  Darden âs lawyers ultimately settled this week for $ million â still a state record in an individual personal injury case  her lawyers said. Such post-verdict settlements are not uncommon in civil cases with large damage awards against municipalities and other deep-pocketed defendants.
âAlthough we believed the verdict would have been upheld on appeal  when weighing the risks and benefits  we felt this was a fair compromise â Patrick Salvi  one of  Darden âs lawyers  said in a statement. â Tierney  has a long  difficult life ahead of  her ; these funds will help  her  obtain all the necessary medical care for the remaining decades of  her  life.â
AIG Aviation  one of the cityâs insurance companies paid out the entire settlement  which was structured in a $ million annuity to cover  Darden âs living expenses and $ million in cash  Salvi said in a phone interview. A spokesman for the New-York-based insurance giant declined to comment.
 Darden âs settlement matches what has been paid out â at least $ million â by the city so far in claims related to disgraced former Chicago police Cmdr. Jon Burge.
In his clientâs case  Salvi said the funds will not only pay for round-the-clock care for Darden  who had been studying modern dance when her spinal cord was severed  but also underwrite her quest to end chronic daily pain she described as âtortureâ during the -day trial.  Darden  is paralyzed from the waist down.
The women had just returned to Chicago from Minneapolis  where they were shopping for bridesmaid dresses for an upcoming wedding   Darden 's lawyers said. A storm rolled through the area as the women were waiting to be picked up  and a -pound pedestrian shelter came loose and fell onto  Darden .
Before the incident   Darden  had lived independently in Chicago and was attending Truman College.
It was determined the shelter that injured Tierney had missing bolts   Darden 's lawyers said. An investigation later found other shelters at O'Hare were poorly maintained  with missing bolts  corroded parts or broken brackets  her lawyers said.The city has since removed all the shelters at OâHare  Salvi said.
 Darden  wasnât available for comment Tuesday  but told reporters at a news conference after the jury verdict last year: âIt didn't have to happen to me. I was more upset than anything and kind of heartbroken because my legs were taken away and those were the two things I needed to do the one thing that I love  which is dance.â","['The settlement comes after a Cook County jury in August deliberated just four hours before awarding Tierney Darden  now   a record $ million in damages.

4431,test,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)  responded Monday to criticism from former Florida Gov. and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush (R) that  he  isnât doing enough to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. In an interview with Politicoâs Marc Caputo   Rubio  claimed that Bush is out of touch with modern political reality  which is that a comprehensive immigration bill that provides a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants currently living in the United States has no realistic chance of passage in the current Senate or of being signed by President Donald Trump.
 Rubio  also discussed many of the mistakes  he  believes  he  made during the course of  his  participation with the so-called Gang of Eight in .
In an interview with USA Today  Bush criticized  Rubio  for not taking a more public leadership role with respect to passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill  which has long been a priority for Bush.
Bush criticized Washington in general for failing to make progress on a comprehensive immigration bill  but singled  Rubio  out for his ire  saying  âGod forbid you actually took on something that was controversial and paid a political price. Thatâs the attitude in D.C. right now. Certainly  Sen. Rubio  is no different in that regard.  Marco  is a talented guy and  he  understands this issue really well  and maybe behind the scenes  he âs working hard. But at some point   his  leadership would be really helpful.â
How did  Rubio  respond to Bush?
 Rubio  criticized Bush for not understanding the current political realities in the Senate and stated that  he  wasnât interested in grandstanding for a bill that had no chance of passage.
âI understand Jebâs passion for immigration. But insisting on a path forward on immigration that has zero chances of passing is not political courage. Itâs legislative malpractice â  Rubio  told Caputo.
 Rubio  further accused Bush of not understanding the significance of Donald Trumpâs election  or the realities within the Republican caucus in the Senate: âI want to get this problem solved. Iâm not interested in impressing people who I believe are in some ways out of touch with the reality that Donald Trump is president and that the people whose votes we need to get this passed donât agree with Jebâs or any of this group of peopleâs views on immigration.â
 Rubio  continued  âThere arenât a lot of Jeb Bush Republicans in the Senate right now. I donât mean that disrespectfully. Thatâs just a fact.â When asked whether he considered himself a âJeb Bush Republican â  Rubio  paused and said  âIâm a Marco Rubio Republican.â
What did  Rubio  say  he  learned from the Gang of Eight debacle?
For one thing   Rubio  says  he  learned that the entire âGang of Eightâ model of legislation â wherein a group of senators crafts a compromise bill and then attempts to force it through without amendments â wonât work on an issue as charged as immigration.  Rubio  told Caputo that  he  understands the criticism raised by then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) who derisively called the Gang of Eight the âmasters of the universeâ in : âhat  he  was alluding to and touching on was this sort of resentment on the part of a lot of members on something so important that this little small group of people devise a plan and say itâs good for America and you either take it or leave it.â
 Rubio  said  he  also realizes that major changes to current immigration policy are impossible for either side right now because of the toxic political environment. Both the White Houseâs plan to eliminate the âdiversity lotteryâ and âchain migration â as well as the Democratsâ plan to provide a path to citizenship for the vast majority of illegal immigrants in this country are doomed to failure because there are enough intractable votes to filibuster either plan that they simply wonât get done.  Rubio  believes that there is broad support for a legislative DACA fix  as well as willingness to include additional border security in any DACA fix.  Rubio  believes that a simple bill should be passed that addresses those two issues and then the rest should be left alone for now.
 Rubio  also stated that  he  would not advocate for a bill that did not have the support of the majority of the Republican caucus  which rules out a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes a path to citizenship:
 He  also did not sound optimistic that an immigration bill of any kind would get done this year  noting that senators on both sides of the aisle face tremendous pressure from their constituents back home not to compromise.","['Sen.

The comments made Moseley only the latest  Moore  defender to downplay the severity of alleged sexual touching initiated by a -year-old man on a -year-old girl.
Beverly Young Nelson on Monday accused  Moore  of what basically amounts to sexual assault â even attempted rape.

She  was  at the time.
One reason for the lack of a united outcry against  Moore  in the GOP has been the questioning about how much wrong he's accused of doing. However crass the lawn mower comparison is  the then--year-old  Leigh Corfman  described a scene in which  Moore  initiated touching  she  wasn't comfortable with  but  she  didn't accuse him of attempted rape or even sexual assault  in so many words.

She  also has a high school yearbook  she  says  Moore  signed for  her .  Moore 's signature and the one in the yearbook appear to match.
It shouldn't be terribly surprising that another woman has come forward with such an allegation â that tends to be the case â but Nelson's allegation takes this in a wholly different direction. If  Moore  was capable of this kind of alleged forcible assault  it stands to reason that there will be more stories to come.
Not that  Moore 's supporters will find it difficult to shift tactics. They'll simply move away from the lawn mower analogies and biblical comparisons to casting doubt on the accusations themselves. But this certainly makes it no longer tenable to claim that this is a misunderstanding from a bygone era in the United States or a very specific region of the country. And these  Moore  defenders have to wonder how much more they'll be asked to defend or dispute in the days and weeks to come.

4438,test," thoughts after the Chicago Bears lost to the New Orleans Saints - on Sunday afternoon at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. . I donât know that there is a player out there in the NFL that has been able to maintain such a positive attitude in the face of such a series of major injuries as Bears tight end  Zach Miller . Maybe such a player exists but I havenât met him. News Monday morning came from ESPNâs Chris Mortensen that  Miller  underwent surgery Sunday night in New Orleans due to extensive damage to  his  left leg  including reported artery damage. A lot of times  Thoughts is led by a key play that decides the game  a big-time performance or perhaps an emerging theme. Itâs impossible to overlook the latest setback for  Miller  though  who suffered what the Bears announced was a dislocated left knee on a corner route in the end zone. Now  we know itâs much more serious than that. Yes  it looked like  Miller  controlled the ball for a touchdown and that is what officials originally ruled. The bigger issue than the play  which was reversed after replay review (more on that a little later) is what looks like the loss of  Miller  for the remainder of the season.  He âs such a well-liked teammate and has always been appreciated by the coaches that have rolled through since former general manager Phil Emery brought  Miller  in back in . âItâs awful to see any of your teammates go down with an injury that necessitates being carted off â said right guard Kyle Long. The two commiserated in rehabilitation just this past season. Long had surgery to repair his badly injured right ankle and  Miller  had surgery to repair  his  broken right foot on the same day at the same hospital last year. They had rooms across from each other. â He âs been here for a long time with me â Long said. â He âs a tough son of a (gun) and  he  is one of the most resilient guys I have ever been around and one of the best human beings I have played with. So my prayers are out to  him .â  The -year-old Miller  has  receptions for  yards and two touchdowns  the only player on the roster with more than one TD grab. But beyond the numbers what has always struck me is what an upbeat and wildly positive guy  Miller  has been.  He âs stuck to it and created a nice career for  himself  while overcoming obstacles that would have turned away a lot of other players. Since   the only Bears player I can think of that was similarly snakebitten when it came to injuries was talented guard Rex Tucker.  He  appeared in  games from  through . This was  Miller âs  game for the Bears in four years. Consider the following injuries: In Week  of the  season   Miller  suffered a broken right foot at MetLife Stadium in a loss to the Giants.  He  had season-ending surgery.
 Miller  badly wanted to complete the  season and appear in all  games but a nagging case of turf toe sidelined  him  for the final game vs. the Lions.
In Week  of the  preseason   Miller  suffered a torn Lisfranc ligament in  his  left foot  leading to season-ending surgery. It came a week after an impressive debut for the Bears with six receptions for  yards and two touchdowns.
Healthy in    he  was waived by the Buccaneers in Week  after what  he  called ânot much of a concussion.â  He  couldn't get a look anywhere.
In the  preseason   he  tore  his  Achilles tendon and calf muscle  sending  him  to injured reserve with the Jaguars.
In Week  of the  season   he  caught a -yard touchdown pass against the Saints but safety Roman Harper hit him on the play  popping his right shoulder out. When the shoulder turned into a recurring injury   he  had season-ending surgery. Each time Miller has suffered a major injury with the Bears   the guy  has come back with a big smile on  his  face.  He  wants to contribute.  He  wants to help teammates.  He  goes about  his  job the right way. Otherwise  thereâs no way in heck the Bears would have considered re-signing a player with such an injury history. Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune Bears tight end Zach Miller holds his leg as he is carted off the field following his injury during the  half against the Saints on Oct.   . Bears tight end Zach Miller holds his leg as he is carted off the field following his injury during the  half against the Saints on Oct.   . (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) âIt was tough â quarterback Mitch Trubisky said. âZach means a lot to this team  beyond the Xâs and Oâs and what he brings on the field  but more what he brings to us as a person. Specifically  to me  how much he has helped me grow over this process.â Everyone in the Bears organization will have Miller in their thoughts in the days ahead. . Iâd like to think the Miller touchdown turned incompletion will get a greater explanation this coming week from the NFLâs head of officiating Alberto Riveron. The league produces a weekly video âOfficial Reviewâ where key plays from the previous week are explained. Perhaps Riveron will shed some light on this and he ought to because based on what I saw on my Twitter timeline after the game  most folks believe referee Carl Cheffers is responsible for the overturned call. Heâs not. That call is made at the NFL office in New York and as ESPNâs Kevin Seifert reported Sunday  the league has been more aggressive with reversals of calls this season. Cheffersâ crew ruled it a touchdown when Miller appeared to make the nifty grab on the corner route with Saints safety Rafael Bush tight in coverage and Millerâs left leg bending awkwardly.
âObviously  we are all familiar with the process of a catch at this point â Cheffers said in a pool report after the game. âSo we ruled that he was going to the ground as part of the process of the catch.â This much  I think we can all agree on. âSo when he goes to the ground  he has to survive the ground â Cheffers continued. No argument there. I think most realize the player has to maintain control after making contact with the ground. âHe went to the ground  he temporarily loses control of the ball â Cheffers said. âThe ball hit the ground  therefore itâs incomplete. The ball hit the ground out of his control. So as part of the process of the catch  he did not complete that process  and therefore it was incomplete and they overturned the call on the field.â This is where Bears fans go bonkers. I watched the replay several times and it appears that the ball shifts ever so slightly in  Miller âs clutch. But does it hit the ground during this movement? Thatâs really hard to say. Enough to overturn the call on the field? Thatâs even harder to accept  especially when the call on the field was touchdown. I think most folks are looking for clear and decisive evidence in a replay  and it would be difficult for a Saints fan to argue that was present here. Thatâs unless there is a replay angle that weâve yet to see  that is more definitive. âThey are always close but that process has been in place for some time now â Cheffers said. âSo that is what we ended up ruling.â Things got off the tracks for me with whatâs a catch and whatâs not a catch on that bizarre Calvin Johnson non-touchdown at Soldier Field back in  with Zack Bowman defending on the play. Perhaps Riveron will be a little more enlightening than Cheffers was and Cheffers makes it pretty clear it was the league office overturning the TD call on the field. Riveron really needs to go over this play in detail. Ultimately  I think everyone wants the same thing and thatâs to feel like they have an understanding for what the call will be and why  especially after theyâve been exposed to reviews. . The injury to  Miller  in the third quarter pressed Daniel Brown into action and he wound up with one reception for  yards. Brown wound up getting  snaps the remainder of the way  including the failed two-point conversion in the fourth quarter and plays wiped out by penalty. I thought Brown was in position to challenge  Miller  for a roster spot when the offseason program began. I thought so because Brown made a nice little debut for the Bears last season after being claimed off waivers from the Ravens. I thought so because we knew  Miller  is injury prone and figured there was a chance the Bears would opt to move a veteran out of the way in order to create playing time for a younger player. I proved to be wrong and in retrospect  it made sense to keep  Miller . The Bears are offensively challenged and  he  was unquestionably the teamâs best red zone target in the passing game. Now  Brownâs opportunity arrives again and weâll see what  he  does with it after being limited to mostly special teams. Photos from the Bears-Saints game at the Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday  Oct.   . âIt sucks â Brown said. âThe kind of relationship you build with the guys in your room  you know  you consider  him  your friend. Weâre all competing for playing time but that is not how I want to get my playing time. It hurts more knowing  he âs my friend. I know I can speak for (rookie) Adam (Shaheen) too   he âs really helped us grow as football players. In the tight end room   he âs been a good leader and a good veteran for us. So itâs going to be tough to miss that presence. âI donât know that  you can replace a Zach Miller . Iâm not saying I can replace  him . I hate it happened to  him . But it is next man up and personally I can say that I want to fill that role to the best of my ability for him  kind of carry on the season for him since he canât.â Weâll see if the Bears simply plug Brown in for  Miller  or if they consider mixing up what theyâre doing at tight end a little bit. Shaheen has been used as a Y tight end along with Dion Sims. I had Shaheen for  snaps in the game. Heâs been getting more and more action. The Bears could consider promoting Ben Braunecker from the practice squad. If special teams is a big factor  and a lot of times it is  Braunecker could be the guy if and when  Miller  goes to IR. . I donât know if the Bears will make a move at kicker before they play again Nov.  against the Packers at Soldier Field. I do know the kicker teams are keeping an eye on  think multiple teams  is Cairo Santos  who was waived by the Chiefs early this season after suffering a groin injury. Barth was wide left from  yards. He also connected from  and  and is now is  for  on the season with two misses from   one from  and one from  that was partially blocked last week against Carolina. The problem is opposing kickers have combined to go  for  in field goal tries. Weâve reached the day and age in the NFL when  for  is borderline even with the misses being from long range. Santos    is . percent in his career on field goals  making  of  tries for the Chiefs. Kansas City waived/injured Santos on Sept.  and heâs visited the Buccaneers for a physical but hasnât been healthy enough yet to have a workout for any of the interested clubs  the Bears included. Some have wondered if Santos will need to sit out the entire season to completely heal and itâs worth noting he also dealt with a groin issue during training camp. The Chiefs tendered Santos at $. million for this season  and they are obligated to pay him while he is still injured. My take on that is thereâs no way Santos wants to risk coming back too soon  miss a few kicks for a new team and then lose his market value for after this season when he will be a free agent (assuming he signs a one-year deal). Heâs making $  per week and can be diligent in his rehabilitation before taking the next step. Whenever Santos is cleared  Iâd guess there is a chance the Bears are in the mix. . New wide receiver Dontrelle Inman was inactive as he didnât practice with the Bears until Friday. The Bears have some extra time to get him going with the bye week and Iâd expect to see him in action against the Packers.
I caught up with a scout from an AFC West club to get a snapshot of Inman  who took the CFL route after playing at the University of Virginia in order to get established. A lot of receivers who try to make that CFL to NFL move fail but he was able to stick with the Chargers. âGood size â the scout said. âHe was hurt in training camp so he didnât do much at all this year. Last year was a bigger year for him. Solid. Reliable. Dependable. Heâs realistically a fourth (wide receiver)  a teams guy. But considering their depth  gosh heâs better than (Josh) Bellamy. Heâs better than better Tre (McBride). Kendall Wright is obviously more talented but itâs a trade that works for both ends in an ideal world. His reps were declining even more with Mike Williams coming back in the mix now. Travis Benjamin making some plays. âHeâs not going to wow you. In an ideal world  like I said  heâs probably a fourth. In their situation  heâs going to climb up the chart. I like the (Tanner) Gentry kid. I think they need to keep that guy. Off the preseason tape  I thought there was some stuff to him. It takes time. Theyâve got a young quarterback and they need to find a guy for him to develop a relationship with. Weâll see. Theyâre hurting so bad. I donât know what the market looks like on teamsâ practice squads right now. So the trade works for both.â It was good to see Tre McBride produce a little. McBride caught three passes for  yards  gaining  on a deep crossing route when Trubisky made a nice throw. Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune Bears tight end  Zach Miller  is unable to retain control of the ball on a pass in the end zone in the  quarter against the Saints. Bears tight end  Zach Miller  is unable to retain control of the ball on a pass in the end zone in the  quarter against the Saints. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) âAs long as they dial it up for me  I will be where I need to be â McBride said. âI hope that we can continue to do this week after week because thatâs what itâs about in this league  consistency. I was really excited to go out there and try to make plays. We didnât get the win and that is what is most important. âIâve had a few weeks. The first three weeks I was here I was inactive and then cut. Since then  Iâve had that time to get a rapport with Mitch. Obviously  it takes longer than three weeks to do that. But weâre working on it and I expect it to continue to develop throughout the year.â Tanner Gentry was targeted only one time and you wonder if he will be the one to lose a little playing time when Inman is in the mix. The Bears also started using Kendall Wright some in two-receiver sets. Previously  heâd been the slot in the three-receiver packages but offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains made a clear move to get Wright on the field more. In my unofficial snap count (and itâs tough with the press box practically on the roof of the Superdome)  I had Wright for  snaps with nine plays where he was one of two wide receivers on the field. âMore than what itâs been â Wright said. âI donât question the coordinator. I donât question the coach. I just do what they tell me to do. If they tell me to go in with two receivers  I go in. They tell me to go in with one  I go in with one. Three? Whatever it is. I just gotta go out and make a play whenever the ball comes to me.â Trubisky was a little wild throwing to Wright. He targeted him eight times but they only hooked up for two completions. Weâll see how the receivers come together after the bye and how the playing time and personnel groupings are put together. . The NFLâs trade deadline is  p.m. Tuesday and chances are the Bears are done wheeling and dealing after the shipping a conditional seventh-round draft pick to the Chargers on Wednesday to acquire veteran receiver Inman  who will be a free agent at the end of the season. General manager Ryan Pace values all draft picks but the wide receiver situation was dire and Inman has experience. He needed to do something to help out rookie quarterback Trubisky. Could the Bears do any more wheeling and dealing? Just two weeks ago I wondered with Pace always interested in adding draft picks (and the Bears have six in  right now)  could the Bears potentially trade a cornerback? Would Kyle Fuller have value on the open market? How about Prince Amukamara? Like Inman  theyâre both headed to free agency at the end of the season. Fuller is playing better than anyone could have imagined  the Bears included  and Amukamara has been solid as well. A position that was a legitimate question mark entering training camp has been steady and thereâs nothing wrong with steady. I checked in with another NFC general manager and he thought Fuller was playing well enough to potentially fetch a late-round pick in return. Think real late. But he added the Bears would have to find a team that was nervous about its cornerbacks and was seeking help. After missing the entire  season  Fuller has started all eight games and he entered Sunday third on the team with  tackles and tops with eight pass deflections  one of which turned into Adrian Amosâ -yard interception return for a touchdown at Baltimore. Surely other teams have caught notice of Fullerâs resurgence. Amukamara missed the first two games with an ankle injury but has now played in six straight and started the last four. Signed to a $ million  one-year contract  itâs a prove-it deal for the former first-round draft pick of the Giants. Amukamara didnât get the multi-year deal he was seeking in March and is hoping a productive season and cut him back at the bargaining table with more leverage. Whatâs interesting is opponents have clearly been motivated to challenge Fuller. Entering this game  he was targeted  times  the fourth-highest total in the NFL behind Philadelphiaâs Jalen Mills and Kansas Cityâs Terrance Mitchell ( each) and the Giantsâ Eli Apple (). Mitchell  it should be noted  is a former Bear. Amukamara and Marcus Cooper were targeted  times combined. So Fuller hasnât scared away opposing offensive coordinators and quarterbacks and there have still been bad plays  ones that are forgotten more quickly than the pass breakups in the end zone. âThatâs what I donât get â said one scout who has watched the Bears recently. âWhy arenât they going at  (Amukamara)?â","[' thoughts after the Chicago Bears lost to the New Orleans Saints - on Sunday afternoon at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. .

Perhaps Riveron will be a little more enlightening than Cheffers was and Cheffers makes it pretty clear it was the league office overturning the TD call on the field. Riveron really needs to go over this play in detail. Ultimately  I think everyone wants the same thing and thatâ\x80\x99s to feel like they have an understanding for what the call will be and why  especially after theyâ\x80\x99ve been exposed to reviews. . The injury to  Miller  in the third quarter pressed Daniel Brown into action and he wound up with one reception for  yards. Brown wound up getting  snaps the remainder of the way  including the failed two-point conversion in the fourth quarter and plays wiped out by penalty. I thought Brown was in position to challenge  Miller  for a roster spot when the offseason program began. I thought so because Brown made a nice little debut for the Bears last season after being claimed off waivers from the Ravens. I thought so because we knew  Miller  is injury prone and figured there was a chance the Bears would opt to move a veteran out of the way in order to create playing time for a younger player. I proved to be wrong and in retrospect  it made sense to keep  Miller . The Bears are offensively challenged and  he  was unquestionably the teamâ\x80\x99s best red zone target in the passing game. Now  Brownâ\x80\x99s opportunity arrives again and weâ\x80\x99ll see what  he  does with it after being limited to mostly special teams. Photos from the Bears-Saints game at the Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday  Oct.   . â\x80\x9cIt sucks â\x80\x9d Brown said. â\x80\x9cThe kind of relationship you build with the guys in your room  you know  you consider  him  your friend. Weâ\x80\x99re all competing for playing time but that is not how I want to get my playing time. It hurts more knowing  he â\x80\x99s my friend. I know I can speak for (rookie) Adam (Shaheen) too   he â\x80\x99s really helped us grow as football players. In the tight end room   he â\x80\x99s been a good leader and a good veteran for us. So itâ\x80\x99s going to be tough to miss that presence. â\x80\x9cI donâ\x80\x99t know that  you can replace a Zach Miller . Iâ\x80\x99m not saying I can replace  him . I hate it happened to  him . But it is next man up and personally I can say that I want to fill that role to the best of my ability for him  kind of carry on the season for him since he canâ\x80\x99t.â\x80\x9d Weâ\x80\x99ll see if the Bears simply plug Brown in for  Miller  or if they consider mixing up what theyâ\x80\x99re doing at tight end a little bit. Shaheen has been used as a Y tight end along with Dion Sims. I had Shaheen for  snaps in the game. Heâ\x80\x99s been getting more and more action. The Bears could consider promoting Ben Braunecker from the practice squad. If special teams is a big factor  and a lot of times it is  Braunecker could be the guy if and when  Miller  goes to IR. . I donâ\x80\x99t know if the Bears will make a move at kicker before they play again Nov.  against the Packers at Soldier Field. I do know the kicker teams are keeping an eye on  think multiple teams  is Cairo Santos  who was waived by the Chiefs early this season after suffering a groin injury. Barth was wide left from  yards. He also connected from  and  and is now is  for  on the season with two misses from   one from  and one from  that was partially blocked last week against Carolina. The problem is opposing kickers have combined to go  for  in field goal tries. Weâ\x80\x99ve reached the day and age in the NFL when  for  is borderline even with the misses being from long range. Santos    is . percent in his career on field goals  making  of  tries for the Chiefs. Kansas City waived/injured Santos on Sept.  and heâ\x80\x99s visited the Buccaneers for a physical but hasnâ\x80\x99t been healthy enough yet to have a workout for any of the interested clubs  the Bears included. Some have wondered if Santos will need to sit out the entire season to completely heal and itâ\x80\x99s worth noting he also dealt with a groin issue during training camp. The Chiefs tendered Santos at $. million for this season  and they are obligated to pay him while he is still injured. My take on that is thereâ\x80\x99s no way Santos wants to risk coming back too soon  miss a few kicks for a new team and then lose his market value for after this season when he will be a free agent (assuming he signs a one-year deal). Heâ\x80\x99s making $  per week and can be diligent in his rehabilitation before taking the next step. Whenever Santos is cleared  Iâ\x80\x99d guess there is a chance the Bears are in the mix. . New wide receiver Dontrelle Inman was inactive as he didnâ\x80\x99t practice with the Bears until Friday. The Bears have some extra time to get him going with the bye week and Iâ\x80\x99d expect to see him in action against the Packers.', 'I caught up with a scout from an AFC West club to get a snapshot of Inman  who took the CFL route after playing at the University of Virginia in order to get established. A lot of receivers who try to make that CFL to NFL move fail but he was able to stick with the Chargers. â\x80\x9cGood size â\x80\x9d the scout said. â\x80\x9cHe was hurt in training camp so he didnâ\x80\x99t do much at all this year. Last year was a bigger year for him. Solid. Reliable. Dependable. Heâ\x80\x99s realistically a fourth (wide receiver)  a teams guy. But considering their depth  gosh heâ\x80\x99s better than (Josh) Bellamy. Heâ\x80\x99s better than better Tre (McBride). Kendall Wright is obviously more talented but itâ\x80\x99s a trade that works for both ends in an ideal world. His reps were declining even more with Mike Williams coming back in the mix now. Travis Benjamin making some plays. â\x80\x9cHeâ\x80\x99s not going to wow you. In an ideal world  like I said  heâ\x80\x99s probably a fourth. In their situation  heâ\x80\x99s going to climb up the chart. I like the (Tanner) Gentry kid. I think they need to keep that guy. Off the preseason tape  I thought there was some stuff to him. It takes time. Theyâ\x80\x99ve got a young quarterback and they need to find a guy for him to develop a relationship with. Weâ\x80\x99ll see. Theyâ\x80\x99re hurting so bad. I donâ\x80\x99t know what the market looks like on teamsâ\x80\x99 practice squads right now. So the trade works for both.â\x80\x9d It was good to see Tre McBride produce a little. McBride caught three passes for  yards  gaining  on a deep crossing route when Trubisky made a nice throw. Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune Bears tight end  Zach Miller  is unable to retain control of the ball on a pass in the end zone in the  quarter against the Saints. Bears tight end  Zach Miller  is unable to retain control of the ball on a pass in the end zone in the  quarter against the Saints. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) â\x80\x9cAs long as they dial it up for me  I will be where I need to be â\x80\x9d McBride said. â\x80\x9cI hope that we can continue to do this week after week because thatâ\x80\x99s what itâ\x80\x99s about in this league  consistency. I was really excited to go out there and try to make plays. We didnâ\x80\x99t get the win and that is what is most important. â\x80\x9cIâ\x80\x99ve had a few weeks. The first three weeks I was here I was inactive and then cut. Since then  Iâ\x80\x99ve had that time to get a rapport with Mitch. Obviously  it takes longer than three weeks to do that. But weâ\x80\x99re working on it and I expect it to continue to develop throughout the year.â\x80\x9d Tanner Gentry was targeted only one time and you wonder if he will be the one to lose a little playing time when Inman is in the mix. The Bears also started using Kendall Wright some in two-receiver sets. Previously  heâ\x80\x99d been the slot in the three-receiver packages but offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains made a clear move to get Wright on the field more. In my unofficial snap count (and itâ\x80\x99s tough with the press box practically on the roof of the Superdome)  I had Wright for  snaps with nine plays where he was one of two wide receivers on the field. â\x80\x9cMore than what itâ\x80\x99s been â\x80\x9d Wright said. â\x80\x9cI donâ\x80\x99t question the coordinator. I donâ\x80\x99t question the coach. I just do what they tell me to do. If they tell me to go in with two receivers  I go in. They tell me to go in with one  I go in with one. Three? Whatever it is. I just gotta go out and make a play whenever the ball comes to me.â\x80\x9d Trubisky was a little wild throwing to Wright. He targeted him eight times but they only hooked up for two completions. Weâ\x80\x99ll see how the receivers come together after the bye and how the playing time and personnel groupings are put together. . The NFLâ\x80\x99s trade deadline is  p.m. Tuesday and chances are the Bears are done wheeling and dealing after the shipping a conditional seventh-round draft pick to the Chargers on Wednesday to acquire veteran receiver Inman  who will be a free agent at the end of the season. General manager Ryan Pace values all draft picks but the wide receiver situation was dire and Inman has experience. He needed to do something to help out rookie quarterback Trubisky. Could the Bears do any more wheeling and dealing? Just two weeks ago I wondered with Pace always interested in adding draft picks (and the Bears have six in  right now)  could the Bears potentially trade a cornerback? Would Kyle Fuller have value on the open market? How about Prince Amukamara? Like Inman  theyâ\x80\x99re both headed to free agency at the end of the season. Fuller is playing better than anyone could have imagined  the Bears included  and Amukamara has been solid as well. A position that was a legitimate question mark entering training camp has been steady and thereâ\x80\x99s nothing wrong with steady. I checked in with another NFC general manager and he thought Fuller was playing well enough to potentially fetch a late-round pick in return. Think real late. But he added the Bears would have to find a team that was nervous about its cornerbacks and was seeking help. After missing the entire  season  Fuller has started all eight games and he entered Sunday third on the team with  tackles and tops with eight pass deflections  one of which turned into Adrian Amosâ\x80\x99 -yard interception return for a touchdown at Baltimore. Surely other teams have caught notice of Fullerâ\x80\x99s resurgence. Amukamara missed the first two games with an ankle injury but has now played in six straight and started the last four. Signed to a $ million  one-year contract  itâ\x80\x99s a prove-it deal for the former first-round draft pick of the Giants. Amukamara didnâ\x80\x99t get the multi-year deal he was seeking in March and is hoping a productive season and cut him back at the bargaining table with more leverage. Whatâ\x80\x99s interesting is opponents have clearly been motivated to challenge Fuller. Entering this game  he was targeted  times  the fourth-highest total in the NFL behind Philadelphiaâ\x80\x99s Jalen Mills and Kansas Cityâ\x80\x99s Terrance Mitchell ( each) and the Giantsâ\x80\x99 Eli Apple (). Mitchell  it should be noted  is a former Bear. Amukamara and Marcus Cooper were targeted  times combined. So Fuller hasnâ\x80\x99t scared away opposing offensive coordinators and quarterbacks and there have still been bad plays  ones that are forgotten more quickly than the pass breakups in the end zone. â\x80\x9cThatâ\x80\x99s what I donâ\x80\x99t get â\x80\x9d said one scout who has watched the Bears recently. â\x80\x9cWhy arenâ\x80\x99t they going at  (Amukamara)?â\x80\x9d']","['thoughts after the

Lost in the Geek Love phenomenon were the two novels that  Dunn  had published some  years earlier  which have struggled to remain in print. âMost people didnât even know Iâd ever written anything else â  Dunn  recalled in . Now  with the reissue of Attic ()  her astonishing debut  readers have a chance to see Katherine Dunn not only as Geek Loveâs author  but as an expansive novelist giving voice to American estrangement. Attic is a jail novel. Largely set on the  floor of the Jackson County Jail in Kansas City  Missouri  it provides a barred window into one womanâs pitilessly violent  radically sexual psyche in the early . That the narrator shares a name with the author suggests that itâs also a book of artistic awakening  a portrait of the artist as a young convict.
Katherine tells the stories of her cell mates  offering a brutal  often heartbreaking glimpse of what working-class Midwestern women endured in a society that would rather lock them up than listen. Take Patsy  who  after being raped as a young woman  cut her hair short and blackened it with shoe polish  becoming someone who âcouldnât say âPass the butterâ without putting into that voice a plea not to be hated.â Patsy is in jail for attempting to murder her rapist  and is now obsessed with a private  theological justice: âShe was always reading her Bible but she only read the parts that were on her side.â Attic requires an iron stomach. An early New York Times review complained that âa great deal of the action takes place near or on the toiletââbut surely this complaint applies to any time spent in the scant interior of a jail cell. Atticâs scatology speaks to what  Katherine âs ravenous imagination must feed on when incarcerated. The toilet becomes a kind of shrine for Katherine  a space in which to work out the neuroses of confinement: I could piss over  piss but I canât piss over her shit  much less shit over it and have them mix. It would be terrible if mine came out lighter or darker than hersâyou could tell whose they were. Even worse if they were the same. Dehumanized by imprisonment   Katherine  seeks remnants of identity in excrement. Yet this consummate jail novel is also a novel of escape. As the plot slows  the days beginning to blend into something like a stable routine  Katherineâs imagination expands outward again into fantasy and memory. Many of her fantasies involve spasms of violence  including what must be one of the earliest visions of a school shooting in American literature: âWalk into the dining hall with a machine gun and spray into their facesâstop them all dead in the laughing with their war stories about Wittgenstein.â
But Katherineâs memories turn the violence back upon herself. She sees memory as âan aggressive thing â and indeed the recollections come as unwilled visitations. Her mother  who frequently inspected the young  Katherine âs genitals for signs of abuse or masturbation  looms largest. In these fragments of memory ( Dunn  said that Attic was composed in five-minute washroom breaks while working three part-time jobs)  we see the genesis of  Katherine âs psychodramatic blend of pleasure and shame: âEven when I was very young I giggled when my mother whipped me.â Dimly  we also perceive an emerging artistic intelligence  one that instinctively retreats to the safety of observation and rejects the instinct for some apocalyptic outburst that might impose her inner torment on the world. When her mother violates her privacy   Katherine  says  in a telling switch to the second person  âYou draw back further and further into some quiet place and watch.â What  she  sees there hints at why  she  fled into the American heartland.  Dunn âs unusual debut came with an unusual author profile. âBefore turning to writing  Katherine Dunn  tried the following occupations â read the dust jacket of the first edition of Attic  citing jobs as an artistâs model  a Sugar Daddy wrapper  and an âInvalidâs companion â among others. The closer-to-fiction reality went unsaid:  Dunn   as  she  later wrote  had been âbig on running awayâ from  her  artistic mother and family of storytelling migrant workers  and had often found  herself  in juvenile-detention centers  even once landing in the Jackson County Jail for peddling magazines.
But the strange book made readers curious to know more. Upon Atticâs publication  The Kansas City Star asked the local sheriff whether he could corroborate its particulars. He indeed remembered Dunnââdifferent from most of the womenââand then nitpicked one of the bookâs most disturbing sequences: âYes   she  could have heard a boy being raped in the menâs section but the sounds would have come through a ceiling grill  not through a steel plate on the same floor.â Atticâs truth doesnât reside in such detailsâor in the other specifics drawn from Dunnâs life. It lies in how jail reshapes Katherineâsâand Dunnâsâconsciousness. For the author  certainly  incarceration changed everything. âI saw myself at a fork in the road â  Dunn  wrote in  in an autobiographical note  âwhere my choices were a life of petty and extremely unglamorous crime  or getting my shit together in a major way.â  She  pulled that off at Reed College  where  she  won a Rockefeller grant for writing  which sustained  her  until  she  went back to part-time jobs. But to judge by  her  first  autobiographical narrator   her  writing practice was profoundly shaped by  her  early experience of jail. The word attic doesnât appear in the novel  yet it suggests a childhood refuge  a private incubator for the imagination  a height from which to contemplate the world below. For better and for worse  the towering Jackson County Jail was  Dunnâs  attic. The novel is far from perfect. Visibly learning on the job   Dunn  tries out different  not always appropriate  angles from which to approach  her  subject. The compulsion to render an image in an original wayâone of the bookâs central strengthsâsometimes leads to a tortured obliqueness. ( Her  cellâs metalwork is âsteelâbut more natural  allowed to flow in its own nonorganic forms  pure tubes and plates without the strain of assuming mock-living shapes.â) Elsewhere   Dunn  is given to breathless run-on sentences that read like Molly Bloomâs castoffs  complete with the punctuating âyes.â  Dunn  herself was impatient with  her  lack of craft  later remarking that in  her  two early works (Truck appeared a year after Attic)   she âd âbeen cranking the stuff all those years only semiconsciously. I opened my mouth and it poured out. It was about as deliberate and artful as belly-button lint.â","['Reviews Attic By Katherine Dunn Vintage Contemporaries Some novels grow so popular that they overwhelm a writerâ\x80\x99s career.

As the plot slows  the days beginning to blend into something like a stable routine  Katherineâ\x80\x99s imagination expands outward again into fantasy and memory.

Dunn â\x80\x99s unusual debut came with an unusual author profile. â\x80\x9cBefore turning to writing  Katherine Dunn  tried the following occupations â\x80\x9d read the dust jacket of the first edition of Attic  citing jobs as an artistâ\x80\x99s model  a Sugar Daddy wrapper  and an â\x80\x9cInvalidâ\x80\x99s companion â\x80\x9d among others.

For the author  certainly  incarceration changed everything. â\x80\x9cI saw myself at a fork in the road â\x80\x9d  Dunn  wrote in  in an autobiographical note  â\x80\x9cwhere my choices were a life of petty and extremely unglamorous crime  or getting my shit together in a major way.â\x80\x9d  She  pulled that off at Reed College  where  she  won a Rockefeller grant for writing  which sustained  her  until  she  went back to part-time jobs.

4450,test,"Larry Nassar  has already been sentenced to  years in prison for child pornography. (Paul Sancya/Associated Press)
In a sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday at a Michigan county court  the stateâs attorney generalâs office asked that former USA Gymnastics and  Michigan State doctor Larry Nassar  be sentenced to  to  years in prison. A sentencing hearing is set to take place next week for  Nassar   who pleaded guilty in November to  counts of sexually assaulting young girls  and it is expected to last several days  with dozens of girls and women to testify about the abuse he inflicted on them under the guise of medical treatment.
According to the Lansing State Journal  prosecutors chose the high end of their request   years  to reflect the number of people who reported assaults by  Nassar  to Michigan State Police. The total number of complaints against him  including from Olympic gold medalists Gabby Douglas  Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney  is more than .
In December   Nassar  was sentenced to  years in prison on federal charges related to child pornography  which  he  is appealing. The -year-old lost  his  physicianâs license in April  approximately three weeks after USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny resigned amid widespread criticism of the organizationâs handling of sexual abuse complaints lodged by athletes and others against  Nassar  and several coaches.
âFor decades  Nassar  preyed upon unknowing victims at every turn and at every opportunity: in the basement of his home  at this medical clinic  at his volunteer gym  at United States Gymnastics training facilities  and at hotels across the world â Michigan assistant attorney general Angela Povilaitis wrote in the sentencing memorandum (via the State Journal).
Michigan State announced in December that it would set up a $ million fund to assist women and girls who have said  Nassar  abused them. The school and USA Gymnastics are the subjects of scores of lawsuits from women and girls claiming not enough was done to protect them from Nassarâs predations.
USA Gymnastics responded to those allegations in a statement Tuesday  saying that it ânever attempted to hide  Nassar âs misconduct.â The organization said it âkept the matter confidential because of the FBIâs directive not to interfere with the investigation. â¦ The information that Maggie and later a second athlete provided was important  but did not provide reasonable suspicion that sexual abuse had occurred.â
On Wednesday  Raisman sharply criticized USA Gymnastics  saying on Twitter  âSTOP VICTIM SHAMING. Your statements are hurtful. If you did not believe that I & others were abused than why pressure & manipulate us? WE WERE MOLESTED BY A MONSTER U ENABLED  THRIVE FOR DECADES. You are % responsible.

The Redskins will receive quarterback Alex Smith once the trade is official on March . The Redskins will give the Kansas City Chiefs a third-round pick and cornerback? Kendall Fuller.  Cousins  will then become a free agent at the start of the league year.
""I knew it would be a tough decision if it came down to deciding what to do in free agency  "" Cousins  told ESPN's NFL Live on Friday. ""So the fact that the decision was made for  me  gave me relief. It certainly was tough emotionally to know I was having to leave a city that I had so many memories. ""
Cousins  also told NFL Live that  he  spoke to several members of the organization the following day  including owner Dan Snyder and coach Jay Gruden.
""Coach Gruden called me the next day and communicated that my desire to draw the process out through March was going to make it tough on them ""  Cousins  said. ""They couldn't afford to wait so they had to make a move. They wanted to do a deal  but because I wanted to go a little longer it put them in a tough spot. So they made the trade. I understood that.  He  said  'I wish you all the best. We had a good run and look forward to seeing you in the future.'  ""

4455,test,"Ted Kennedy Jr.  son of the late Massachusetts senator   said Wednesday  he  will not seek a third term in the Connecticut Senate because  he  wants to focus on protecting disability rights  which  he  said are under ""an enormous threat"" at the federal level.
 The -year-old Democrat with the famous last name  who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for offices from governor to U.S. senator   said  he  feels compelled to play a bigger role in the disability rights community.
""We have an enormous threat to the rights of people with disabilities in the current administration. I don't feel I can sit by and watch that erosion take place ""  he  told The Associated Press in an interview.  His  state Senate term ends at the end of the year.
Asked whether  he  might return to elective politics   Kennedy  said not to count  him  out  adding how  he 's now redirecting  his  political activism.
""I don't know what the future holds  but I know what's in front of  me  right now ""  he  said. ""Nothing is more important to  me  than defending the rights of people with disabilities.""
 Kennedy  lost  his  right leg to bone cancer when  he  was  years old. An attorney who has worked on disability and environmental issues   Kennedy  said  he 's been a member of the American Association of People with Disabilities for the past  years. Last summer   Kennedy  decided to become chairman of the group's board of directors  concerned about what  he  sees are rollbacks of disability rights   he  said.
 Kennedy  cited a bill that recently cleared the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives that would amend the Americans With Disabilities Act. While proponents contend the bill curbs lawyers who threaten businesses with frivolous ADA-related lawsuits  disability rights advocates said legislation discourages businesses from complying with the law.
 Kennedy  said  he 's also concerned about changes in protections for people with pre-existing conditions and the small number of attorneys working at U.S. Department of Justice on ADA compliance matters.
As chairman of the American Association of People with Disabilities   Kennedy  said  he  plans to ""rev up"" a campaign to register  million new voters with disabilities between now and Election Day.  He  also plans to persuade thousands of companies to adopt policies that protect the rights of workers with disabilities.","['Ted Kennedy Jr.  son of the late Massachusetts senator   said Wednesday  he  will not seek a third term in the Connecticut Senate because  he  wants to focus on protecting disability rights  which  he  said are under ""an enormous threat"" at the federal level.', ' The -year-old Democrat with the famous last name  who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for offices from governor to U.S. senator   said  he  feels compelled to play a bigger role in the disability rights community.', '""We have an enormous threat to the rights of people with disabilities in the current administration.

4458,test,"Ike Holter  has written a major  seven-play series about the strife and humanity to be found in  his  home city of Chicago. You may have even seen some of them. You just likely didnât have the full picture. Let me try and explain. Iâve only just been able fully to grasp it  myself .
The -year-old Holter â whose astonishing writing talent Iâve admired since  he  exploded here in  with a gorgeous play called âHit the Wallâ â moves in fancy circles these days.  He âs represented by a top agent at William Morris Endeavor.  He  was a  winner of Yale Universityâs Windham-Campbell Prize  one of the most lucrative honors in playwriting  given that it comes with a check for $   no strings attached. When I caught up with  Holter  last weekend   he  was about to hop a plane to London to work with the National Theatre of Great Britain  arguably the leading contemporary company in the English-speaking world.
All this and  Holter  still finds time to make friends  and trouble  on Facebook.
But back to this series â which I think  once people wrap their heads around it  might just be one of the most significant literary achievements in modern-day Chicago. An obviously flattering comparison would be August Wilsonâs iconic cycle chronicling everyday African-American life in Pittsburgh (and in Chicago  in one play) in each decade of the  century.  Holter  is a very different kind of writer  of course  and all of  his  plays are set in the present. The Rightlynd Cycle (letâs call it that) might actually be closer to Keith Huffâs trio (three so far  anyway) about the Chicago Police Department and the moral choices and conundrums faced by police officers. You can (and should) see the latest of those Huff works right now â the gripping âSix Corners â as produced by American Blues Theater at Stage .
But back to  Holter . Here â world exclusive  folks â is a full listing of how this chronological cycle will continue to unfold. This is the first announcement of some of these productions. And  by the way  all of these plays are scheduled to be published by Northwestern University Press.
The series begins with âRightlynd â which you will be able to see in the fall at Victory Gardens Theater. Rightlynd is the name of  Holter âs fictional Chicago neighborhood â somewhere within the  Ward. (If youâre not from Chicago  you might not know that the city has  wards. Holter is a comic book geek as well as a politically aware scribe.) âRightlyndâ introduces the character of Ald. Nina Esposito  a woman dedicated to opposing Chicagoâs famous political machine  but also in danger of turning into the very thing she opposes.
In February of   Teatro Vista produced the next play  âThe Wolf at the End of the Block â a piece about violent crime and mistrust of the police thatâs set in a Chicago bar. This show  lean and concise  features one particularly explosive scene  formidably performed for Teatro Vista by actors Bear Bellinger and James D. Farruggio. It showed  Holter  at  his  most complex and very best. âWolfâ is slated to be produced again at the  Street Theater in Berwyn.
Youâve not yet seen  Holter âs next play â âRed Rex.â Itâs slated for January at Steep Theatre and he says itâs all about a storefront Chicago theater company  full of idealistic artists and thus not unlike Steep itself  that takes over an old storefront theater and  alas for them  cannot help but gentrify the neighborhood. That one  I suspect  everyone will want to see.
At that point â there will be just one left  âLottery Day â slated for a major production at the Goodman Theatre in April   and taking place at a Chicago barbecue.  Holter  says  he  plans to bring back characters  and even lines  from all of the other plays. âIt will be a huge production and the big closing â  he  says  âand a goodbye to all these relationships.â And yes  Esposito will be there. Sheâs to be a talisman; kind of Holterâs version of Wilsonâs Aunt Esther.
I asked  Holter  if  he  thought the plays had a single  overarching theme. It was not entirely a fair question  but this is what  he  said:","['Ike Holter  has written a major  seven-play series about the strife and humanity to be found in  his  home city of Chicago.

4461,test,"Gov. Bruce Rauner  on Monday watched U.S. Supreme Court arguments in a union fees case sparked by one of  his  first actions as governor  saying afterward that free speech and the battle against âconflicts of interest and corruptionâ were at stake.
In   the Republican governor issued an executive order and filed a legal case aiming to ban public-sector unions from collecting fees from government workers who opted out of a union. The move put the issue on a track to the high court  even though  Rauner  is no longer officially involved in the case.
Speaking to reporters Monday   Rauner  said government employee union contributions to politicians were tantamount to âbribes.â
âEverything a government union does is political by its very nature â  Rauner  continued. âIt impacts taxpayers; it impacts government and politics. One hundred percent of what a government union does is political by nature  therefore forced payment of dues is political speech.â
The governor arrived in Washington on Sunday and marked what he called his first meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House Governorsâ Ball hosted by the president.  Rauner  has kept Trump at armâs length in the past and at times has declined to use the presidentâs name. He said his talks with the president at the White House were not extensive  calling them âmore a social opportunity.â
A lower court ruled that  Rauner  did not have standing in the case because he is not a union member  but another plaintiff was found: Mark Janus  a state employee in Springfield who objected to the roughly $ per month deduction from his paycheck that went to the American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees.
The governor said he and other governors spent more time with Vice President Mike Pence. Penceâs chief of staff  Nick Ayers  ran  Rauner âs first campaign in .  Rauner  also said  he  had meetings in D.C. with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and with U.S. Transportation Department officials.  He  said  he  wanted to maximize help from the federal government to pay for improvements to state roads and bridges.
 Rauner  noted  he  had visited the White House when Democrat Barack Obama was president.  He  said Monday that  he  would work with the Illinois General Assembly to obtain funding for millions of dollars in infrastructure improvements surrounding the future Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park on Chicagoâs South Side.
 He  said it was a âvery  very important opportunity for the people of Illinoisâ and said the center would be a âgreat tourist drawâ and âgreat economic engine.â

4463,test,"PHOENIX (AP) â People have been comparing the political styles of President Donald Trump and  former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio  since the allies starting appearing together at campaign events.
 The -year-old Arpaio  noted those similarities Wednesday  a day after  he  announced  his  candidacy for the Senate seat now held by Republican Jeff Flake  a Trump critic whoâs not seeking re-election.
They include a focus on immigration enforcement  a knack for getting away with things that would sink the careers of other politicians and a talent for garnering news coverage   Arpaio  said.
âIsnât it great to be compared to the president of the United States?â  Arpaio  told The Associated Press at  his  office in a Phoenix suburb.
 Arpaio  blames the agency for  his  criminal conviction over intentionally defying a judgeâs order to stop traffic patrols that targeted immigrants  though the charge was recommended by the judge.
Trump  who later pardoned  Arpaio   has attacked the Justice Department over its investigation into Russian meddling in the  election  when the sheriff was voted out of office.
 Arpaio âs candidacy injects new uncertainty and attention into the race thatâs already among the yearâs most watched. He will face another pro-Trump candidate  former state Sen. Kelli Ward  in the GOP primary.
 Arpaio  said the lack of support for the presidentâs agenda in Washington inspired him to run but insists he isnât running on a pro-Trump platform.
âPeople are not going to vote for me just being pro-Trump â  Arpaio  said.
The paperwork from Arpaioâs pardon  which spared him a possible jail sentence when Trump granted it four months ago  is framed on a wall next to his office desk. Bobblehead dolls of  Arpaio  and Trump stand side by side atop a shelf. And photos of  Arpaio  with presidents  including Trump and Barack Obama  hang on the walls.
âI think he would just suck up most of her support. He is a much more prominent and visible person  heâs been around so long â said David Berman  a senior research fellow at Arizona State Universityâs Morrison Institute of Public Policy. âMost people who like Trump generally gravitate toward  Arpaio .â

For now  it will be  Bortles  trying to rebound from  his  -for- passing performance against the Bills as the third-seeded Jaguars attempt to upset the second-seeded Steelers and advance to the AFC title game.
 Bortles  acknowledged after the victory over the Bills that itâs âusually not ideal for a quarterbackâ to have more rushing yards than passing yards in a game. But as least it was part of a winning effort  he said.

Belle Gibson  the former health blogger  cookbook author and app developer who lied about having terminal brain cancer and built a business around her âwellnessâ advice  has been fined $  over her misleading and deceptive claims.
 Gibson     was found guilty of misleading or deceptive conduct in March this year by justice Debra Mortimer of the Federal Court in Melbourne. She did not defend the legal action by Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV)  nor take part in the case.
Justice Mortimer concluded that âmost but not allâ of the breaches of Australian Consumer Law alleged against  Gibson  by CAV were proved.
And she did not accept that  Gibson  had acted unconscionably  saying it was possible that âsome kind of delusionâ played a part in her belief that she had cancer.
 Gibson   then   became a regular on the celebrity wellness circuit for her âmiraculousâ recovery from terminal illness thanks to her diet  before her empire came crumbling down two years ago after Fairfax Media revealed she had failed to pass on donations she promised to make to charities.
Melbourne-based Gibsonâs fraud began in  and she rose to prominence on social media by claiming she had survived terminal illness for five years using diet and traditional remedies. It led to a best-selling wellness app on Appleâs iTunes store  and when the Apple Watch was launched   Gibson âs app played a central part in the companyâs marketing.
Apple had flown  Gibson  to the US to work on the watch app prior to its launch  but when doubts over Gibsonâs claims emerged  the app was pulled  followed by her book.
 Gibson  maintained she would provide details of her illness right up until an interview in April  with Australian Womenâs Weekly in which she finally confessed her deception.
In June    Gibson  appeared on  Minutes and tried to defend her lies  claiming âIâve not been intentionally untruthfulâ.
CAV took legal action against  Gibson  and  her  company Inkerman Road Nominees Pty Ltd  last year  shortly after it was placed into liquidation owing more than $ . The matter went to trial last September.
Around $  was donated to charity when  Gibson  had claimed the figure was in excess of $ .
As part of the CAVâs investigation  publisher Penguin Australia agreed to pay $  to a Victoriaâs consumer law fund for publishing  Gibson âs book  The Whole Pantry  without properly fact checking.","['Belle Gibson  during  her   minutes interview.

4467,test,"CHARLOTTE  Mich. (AP) â The final sentencing hearing began Wednesday for disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar  who was again confronted by victims as he faced another prison sentence for molesting gymnasts at an elite Michigan club run by an Olympic coach.
Judge Janice Cunningham has set aside several days for more than  women and girls who want to confront  Nassar  or have their statement read in court. The hearing could unfold much the same as a hearing last week in another county where a different judge allowed more than  women and girls to confront  Nassar  about  his  abuse.
That hearing ended with  Nassar  getting sentenced to  to  years in prison  with the judge describing it as Nassarâs âdeath warrant.â
Annie Labrie said what  Nassar  did to her made her âskin crawl â but every adult around her assured her he was the only option  and she hid the abuse from her parents. She said it is imperative for society to understand Nassarâs pedophilia was not an isolated incident  and gymnastics and gyms like Twistars have a âspecific cultureâ that allows people like him to flourish.
The practice of allowing accusers to speak even if they are not tied directly to a case has raised questions about fairness. But attorneys say the victim statements probably pose little risk on appeal  especially since  Nassar  pleaded guilty  agreed to allow the statements and is expected to get another long prison sentence as part of  his  deal with prosecutors.
âHer obvious delight was just off the wall â Raben said  referring to Aquilinaâs âdeath warrantâ remark and others. âI am not defending  Larry Nassar  at all  but what I saw with  her  was a real abandonment of judicial demeanor. â¦ The process doesnât change because everybody hates the defendant. That is the absolute glory  or should be  of the American justice system.â
The case on Cunninghamâs docket Wednesday in Eaton County centers on Nassarâs assaults at Twistars  a Lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by  Olympic coach John Geddert.  Nassar  admits penetrating three girls with  his  hands when  he  was supposed to be treating them for injuries.

4469,test,"âThey took the cup out of my hand and took me away â  Jim Mulcahy  told The Daily Beast from an undisclosed location in Eastern Europe.
The news teams called  him  a pseudo-priest. The police demanded to know  through an English-language translator  in an on-camera closeup: âWhatâs the purpose of your being here right now? â
Mulcahy  a Metropolitan Community Church pastor whoâs been living in Ukraine for four years   was swiftly ordered to leave Russia for allegedly violating the terms of  his  tourist visa. News reports about the event included snide comments about  him  being an American  an openly gay man  a resident of Ukraine  and an MCC pastor.
âIâve been going to Russia at least once a year since  â  Mulcahy  said  speaking out about the events for the first time. âI always visit LGBT groups while Iâm there  for conversation.â
âFortunately  Russia canât throw me out of Eastern Europe or post-Soviet space â  Mulcahy  said. âThey can only throw me out of Russia.â
But the Russian cops did bring a  p.m. tea party on July  to an abrupt end when they stormed the Avers gathering. About a dozen people were in the room  âliterally drinking tea and eating cookies â  Mulcahy  said.
âProbably around  minutes after we started  four police and news cameras came barging in  and I was taken into custody â  he  said. âThey didnât give me any reason  they just took me. I had no interpreter of my own  I had no lawyer with me.â
They grilled the pastor for four hours  using only a police-provided translator.  Mulcahy  couldnât even fully understand what was going on   he  said  and  his  lawyerâwho was at the police stationâwasnât allowed to call  him .
Later  the attorney told  Mulcahy  that police got an anonymous tip that  he  was going to perform a same-sex wedding in Samara  just like  he  had for dozens of same-sex couples around the world. The men who reported  him   based on advertisements for the tea party in Russian social network Vkontakte  gleefully said as much to news crews.
âI had no such plans â  Mulcahy  said.
Russian TV reported that evening that  Mulcahy  would be fined and thrown out of the country. That night  a judge ruled that same way.
 Mulcahy  was given five days to get out  and banned for three years.  He  was given a fine of   rublesâa whopping $.
âRussia is the second country Iâve been kicked out of â  he  said.
As a young Jesuit scholastic   Mulcahy  was driven out of Iraq and moved to Egypt instead.

4473,test,"Deemed the âWhite Christmasâ episode of the season based on its multiple storyline formula  âBlack Museumâ is anything but. As Nish (played by Letitia Wright  Black Panther) roams through Rolo Haynesâ Black Museum during a three-hour futuristic pit stop  we almost immediately shuffle in our seats.
Sheâs met by Haynes himself  who takes her on a tour through his haunted house of horrors. We  along with Nish  are walked through a series of now-illegal and ethically questionable objects on display: A borderline-BDSM neurological hat that allowed a doctor to overdose on sexual pleasure from his patientâs pain  a neurological device that evicts a personâs consciousness from their body to live rent-free in someone elseâs mind  and finally  a digital hologram of an incarcerated black man in a cell. We find that itâs none other than Clayton Leigh  a wrongfully-convicted murderer on death row whose consciousness is now etched in digital eternity. Weâre told his story: When Haynes worked as a business med-tech (whatever that is) he visited Clay in jail and offered him a way out of his execution by digitally immortalizing his essence into a permanent hologram in exchange for money for his family.
This is the final straw for Nish  who reveals herself to be his daughter here on a redemptive mission to bring Haynes down.
Nish points out the protests after Clayâs sentencing and the museum closing down  except for a few racist  voyeuristic one-offs who paid extra to keep Haynes in business. Nish condemns him to an eternal life of electrocution (solidified via souvenir) by locking Hayneâs consciousness into Clayâs virtual one and is finally able to say her goodbyes.
 Nish  burns the museum down  and we find that  her  dead mother shares occupancy inside Nishâs mind  as well.
 Nish  is proof that not all heroines wear capes.
We are emotional secret-keepers. Much like  Nish âs undercover status  weâre asked to forego our feelings for the sake of âsocially acceptabilityâ (read: white fragility). Weâre denied the full spectrum of our emotions in order to move through our daily professional (and sometimes personal) livesâeven when flash anger is due.
Nishâs revenge is not only justified; itâs well-deserved.
As if operating in a parallel universe  Nishâs fictional character comes at a time when real-life -year-old Erica Garner (daughter of Eric Garner who died from a police chokehold in ) recently passed following a heart attack and months after giving birth. Erica became an activist in light of her fatherâs death and not only had to face the stateâs glaring miscarriage of justice but all the media discourse that also came with it.
Much like Nish and Clay  âBlack Museumâ also puts us face to face with past realities like the gynecological experimentation of enslaved Black women  the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in the   the forced sterilization of Native American women in the   and beyond.
Nevertheless  thereâs a tinge of hope by the episodeâs end. Clayâs wife living on as an inhabitant of Nishâs consciousness is a powerful testament to the reclamation of the Black mind. For a show that has a proven obsession with Black suffering  it seems like a subtle step in the right direction.","['Deemed the â\x80\x9cWhite Christmasâ\x80\x9d episode of the season based on its multiple storyline formula  â\x80\x9cBlack Museumâ\x80\x9d is anything but.

ANDREW POLLACK: Yes. So one of the reasons why Iâm here is because thereâs been  shootings already in this country and thereâs a reason why it hasnât stopped because after every shooting.

4476,test,"President Trump used Twitter Saturday to suggest that  Andrew McCabe  the FBI's increasingly embattled deputy director   was holding onto  his  position in a race against time to claim full pension benefits.
Trump said  McCabe  was ""racing the clock"" in one tweet Saturday:
""FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits.  days to go?!!!""
 McCabe 's retirement has been rumored in Washington  D.C.  circles for some time  but the president seemed to be responding to a report published Saturday afternoon by the Washington Post that  McCabe  plans to retire after  he  becomes eligible to receive full pension benefits in March .
""How can  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe  the man in charge  along with leakin' James Comey  of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her   illegally deleted emails)  be given $  for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?""
NPR's Ryan Lucas has previously reported that  McCabe  was eligible to retire with a full pension in March and is expected to remain in  his  job until then despite the political pressure to remove  him .
NPR's Carrie Johnson tweeted Saturday  she has also been told by people with knowledge of the matter that  McCabe  is likely to take vacation time that  he  has accrued after nearly  years as an FBI agent  which would effectively have  him  out of the building before  his  official final day at the FBI sometime in March.
"" He 's got about  days  and some of that will be holiday time.  He  can make it "" one source familiar with matter also said  according to the Washington Post's report.
 McCabe  spent some  hours in closed-door meetings with three House Committees this week â Oversight  Judiciary and Intelligence. Republicans were reportedly  dissatisfied with some of  his  answers.

4477,test,"Seoul  South Korea (CNN)  South Korean surgeon Lee Cook-Jong  was already having a busy day in Trauma Bay  when  he  got the call: A US Black Hawk helicopter was on its way with an injured soldier. But it wasn't just any soldier.
""I was informed that  he  was badly shot by North Koreans ""  Lee  said  reliving the complex chain of events that brought North Korean defector Oh Chong Song to  his  trauma unit on November .
 Lee  says  he  went to meet  his  critically injured patient on the helipad  just a few hundred feet from the state-of-the-art  US-modeled trauma center  he  runs at Ajou University Hospital in the South Korean capital  Seoul.
The chopper was coming in fast  and for that   he  says   he  was thankful.
"" His  vital signs were so unstable   he  was dying of low blood pressure   he  was dying of shock ""  Lee  said.
"" He  was like a broken jar. We couldn't put enough blood into  him .""
Riddled with bullets   he  was dragged to safety by South Korean soldiers and hovered close to death during the -minute airlift to hospital.
What unfolded after the Black Hawk touched down was a harrowing effort to keep Oh alive that lasted more than six hours -- captured in video  Lee  shared exclusively with CNN  with the permission of the soldier.
In the first  minutes  after Oh was rushed into Trauma Room One   Lee  and  his  team worked to keep Oh breathing.
"" He  has one (bullet) through  his  right knee joint; the other one is the tricep muscle area on  his  arm  the third one was  his  back; chest and coming out from  his  shoulder  "" Lee  said as  he  reviewed the video.
During a five-hour operation to remove a bullet that had pierced Oh's intestines   Lee  encountered a complication  he 's never seen in  his  -year career as a surgeon: parasites.
 Lee  describes working to repair at least seven wounds in the defector's perforated bowel while the white worms were squirming their way out of Oh's body.
""Everything was stained with blood  but the parasite was basically a really white color and this thick  big  long and very  very hard  this kind of thing was getting out from  his  bowel system  "" Lee  said.
The worms  Lee  removed from Oh's body.
 Lee  describes Oh's vital signs as so unstable that a few times during the grueling operation   he  thought the defector would die on the surgical table.
""It's a miracle that  he  survived  "" Lee  said.","[""Seoul  South Korea (CNN)  South Korean surgeon Lee Cook-Jong  was already having a busy day in Trauma Bay  when  he  got the call: A US Black Hawk helicopter was on its way with an injured soldier.

4479,test,"None of these storylines  however  will have more to do with the game than how Jaguarsâ lightning-rod quarterback Blake Bortles performs Sunday.
Ask anyone involved in this game â Marrone  the Bills  Jaguars or Bills fans â and theyâll tell you that how  Bortles  plays will dictate how this game goes.
There might not be a more maligned player in the NFL than  Bortles . Even when he plays well  he gets ripped.
After the Jaguars beat the Seahawks last month  Seattle safety Earl Thomas called  Bortles  âa sub-par quarterback.ââ
âAs long as  Blake Bortles  is back there  if the ball game is in his hands  heâs going to choke.â
 Bortles  has been a feast-or-famine quarterback for most of  his  career. For example   he  threw  touchdown passes to  interceptions in   but the Jags still went -.
This season  under the coaching of Marrone   he  has played much more within  himself   throwing just  TDs  but  his   INTs is a career-low â though five of those have come in the past two games.
The Jaguars  whose strength is their defense  have much of everything in place for success. The fact is their chances of winning this game hinge almost completely on the way  Bortles  plays.
If  he  doesnât turn the ball over  the Jaguars are almost guaranteed to advance to the AFC divisional playoff round against the Steelers  whom they defeated earlier this season in Pittsburgh.

 Rubio  expressed  his  reservations in an interview with southwest Floridaâs News-Press Thursday  noting  he  thinks Republicans probably gave corporations too much of a handout.

4483,test,"Chip Kelly  is a wanted man.
The former Oregon and NFL coach likely has a decision to make about his next coaching stop: Florida or UCLA?  Kelly   currently working as an ESPN college football analyst  met with Florida officials Sunday afternoon. When UCLA fired coach Jim Mora earlier that day  multiple industry sources said the school would pursue  Kelly .
Both Florida and UCLA are attractive options for  Kelly   who led Oregon to three Pac- titles  a national title game appearance  a Rose Bowl championship and a Fiesta Bowl championship in just four seasons as head coach. Both Florida and UCLA are located in talent hotbeds. Both have recently made overdue commitments to facility upgrades. While Florida has a national championship tradition  UCLA always has been viewed as a sleeping giant.
ESPN reached out to coaches and others to gauge which school  Kelly  should pick and why. The near consensus:  Kelly  should head west again.
Coaches pointed to  Kelly 's knowledge of the Pac- and its recruiting scene as reasons?  he  should pick UCLA.
"" He  is more familiar with the Pac- "" a Pac- coordinator said. ""You're going to get big-time players there no matter what. You just have to take the right ones and evaluate well.""
 Kelly  isn't in love with recruiting  which could make life in the competitive SEC especially challenging and annoying. But Oregon grew into a national brand during  his  tenure  and the Ducks had success landing players from Texas and California.?
""That's where people know  him  now "" said a Power  head coach. "" He  came from New Hampshire  but  he 's established  himself  from a recruiting standpoint in that part of the world.""?
UCLA also brings in top recruits from outside the state  but  Kelly  could focus much more on Southern California.  He  also wouldn't need to go far for talent at Florida.
The biggest difference in  Kelly 's options could come outside of the football facility. Los Angeles offers eight major pro teams  USC and the entertainment industry. In Gainesville   Kelly  would be the second-biggest celebrity behind Steve Spurrier.?
At Oregon   Kelly  benefited from a program steeped in Nike money that spared no expense to elevate its profile. Florida and UCLA  meanwhile  have both faced criticism -- even by former coaches like Jim McElwain and Rick Neuheisel -- for a lack of commitment. It certainly played a role in the McElwain-Florida divorce last month. A $ million facility is finally on the way at Florida  and UCLA in August opened the $ million Wasserman Football Center on campus  a massive upgrade from what the program had before. Former UCLA tight end Charles Arbuckle said UCLA's decision to pay Jim Mora's $ million buyout indicates a shift.
 Kelly  coached Oregon to college football's biggest stages and is believed to be considering jobs where  he  feels like  he  could win a national title. Florida has a clear edge here  as both Spurrier and Urban Meyer won national titles in Gainesville. UCLA has only one national title  in   and hasn't won the Pac- since  (then the Pac-). Then again  Oregon wasn't a national title contender until  Kelly  arrived.
Coaches have little doubt  Kelly  could succeed at both schools. His offense would draw different types of players to Florida  but it could also help the Gators stand out. While UCLA's reboot must start on defense  Florida fans accustomed to Spurrier's Fun 'n' Gun and Meyer's offense are craving points.
At some point soon   Kelly  will choose  his  next coaching destination. Florida and UCLA are both exciting landing spots  and more opportunities could be coming  his  way.

In past years   Pavlensky  has sewn his mouth shut  rolled naked in barbed wire and nailed his scrotum to cobblestones in Moscow's Red Square. Kulik has roamed around nude on all fours growling like a dog.
His radical denunciations of the state previously landed him in jail.

A few days after  Pavlensky  spoke to USA TODAY  he was arrested in Paris for setting fire to another bank  an act of destruction he considers performance art.

4492,test,"Jeff Bartos  has dropped  his  bid for Pennsylvaniaâs Senate race to seek the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor  joining forces with gubernatorial candidate and State Senator Scott Wagner.
In a video announcement Wagner  a current state senator  lauded  Bartos  as a man who will work with him to take on career politicians  â Jeff  is a person who wants to change the way Harrisburg works.â
The move means  Bartos  is leaving a race to take U.S. Sen. Bob Caseyâs seat.  Bartos  had been facing off against Rep. Lou Barletta for the Republican nomination and opportunity to challenge Casey. Barletta was an early supporter of now President Donald Trump.  Bartos  had amassed over $ million for  his  Senate campaign which now serves as an asset in  his  quest to become the next Lieutenant Gov. of Pennsylvania. About half of that total represents loans from  Bartos  to  his  own campaign.
Wagner promises in the video that the two will  âchange the way things have always been done in Harrisburg.  Jeff  will help me make Harrisburg work for you  the taxpayers â not special interests or insiders.â
âMy life has been in business  not politics â  Bartos  emphasizes in the video. He described Wagner as a âtoughâ but âfairâ conservative businessman who has âbuilt his waste company from the ground up into a major job engine  right here in central Pennsylvania.â
 Bartos  remarks that Wagner has lived the American dream and now wants to âuse his experience to make Pennsylvania win again.â
 Bartos â words echo President Donald Trumpâs frequent promises to make America great again  make America win again. In his inaugural address Trump said  âAmerica will start winning again  winning like never before.â
âScottâs knows what it takes to win  and thatâs what heâll do. We both will â said  Bartos .

Over several weeks of emailing back and forth  Jennifer confides in me some of the tricks  she  uses to mask  her  autismâfor example  staring at the spot between someoneâs eyes instead of into their eyes  which makes  her  uncomfortable. But when we speak for the first time over video chat one Friday afternoon in January  I cannot pick up on any of these ploys.  She  confesses to being anxious. âI didnât put on my interview face â  she  says. But  her  nervousness  too  is hiddenâat least until  she  tells me that  she  is tapping  her  foot off camera and biting down on the chewing gum in  her  mouth. The only possible âtellâ I notice is that  she  gathers up hanks of  her  shoulder-length brown hair  pulls them back from  her  face  and then lets them dropâover and over again.
In the course of more than an hour   Jennifer   a -year-old writer  describes the intense social and communication difficulties  she  experiences almost daily.  She  can express  herself  easily in writing   she  says  but becomes disoriented during face-to-face communication. âThe immediacy of the interaction messes with my processing â  she  says. âAm I making any sense at all?â  she  suddenly bursts out.  She  is  but often fears  she  is not. To compensate   Jennifer  says  she  practices how to act. Before attending a birthday party with  her  son  for example   she  prepares  herself  to be âon â correcting  her  posture and habitual fidgeting.  She  demonstrates for me how  she  sits up straight and becomes still.  Her  face takes on a pleasant and engaged expression  one  she  might adopt during conversation with another parent. To keep a dialogue going   she  might drop in a few well-rehearsed catchphrases  such as âgood griefâ or âgo big or go home.â âI feel if I do the nods  they wonât feel Iâm uninterested â  she  says. Over the past few years  scientists have discovered that  like  Jennifer   many women on the spectrum âcamouflageâ the signs of their autism. This masking may explain at least in part why three to four times as many boys as girls are diagnosed with the condition. It might also account for why girls diagnosed young tend to show severe traits  and highly intelligent girls are often diagnosed late. (Men on the spectrum also camouflage  researchers have found  but not as commonly as women.)
Delaine Swearman    says she wanted badly to fit in when she was about  or   but felt she was too different from the other girls in her school. She studied the girls she liked and concluded  âIf I pretended to like everything they liked and to go along with everything  that maybe they would accept me â she says. Her schoolmates were avid fans of the band New Kids on the Block. So Swearman  who says she had zero interest in the band  feigned a passion she did not feel. She made a few more friends  but felt she was never being herself. Swearman  like  Jennifer   was not diagnosed until adulthood  when  she  was . Even when teachers do flag girls for an autism evaluation  standard diagnostic measures may fail to pick up on their autism. For example  in a study last year  researchers looked at  boys and  girls with autism. They analyzed the childrenâs scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and on parent reports of autism traits and daily living skills  such as getting dressed. They found that even when the girls have ADOS scores similar to those of boys  they tend to be more severely impaired: The parents of girls included in the study had rated their daughters lower than the boys in terms of living skills and higher in terms of difficulties with social awareness and restricted interests or repetitive behaviors. The researchers say girls with less severe traits  especially those with high IQs  may not have scored high enough on the ADOS to be included in their sample in the first place.
To evaluate some of these methods  Mandy  Lai  and their colleagues in the United Kingdom surveyed  women   men  and seven individuals who are either transgender or âotherâ gendered  all diagnosed with autism. They asked what motivates these individuals to mask their autism traits and what techniques they use to achieve their goal. Some of the participants reported that they camouflage in order to connect with friends  find a good job  or meet a romantic partner. âCamouflaging well can land you a lucrative job â  Jennifer  says. âIt helps you get through social interaction without there being a spotlight on your behavior or a giant letter A on your chest.â Others said they camouflage to avoid punishment  to protect themselves from being shunned or attacked  or simply to be seen as ânormal.â âI actually got told by a couple of my teachers that I needed to have âquiet hands ââ says Katherine Lawrence  a -year-old woman with autism in the United Kingdom. âSo I had to resort to hiding my hands under the table and ensuring my foot tapping and leg jiggling remained out of sight as much as possible.â Lawrence  who was not diagnosed with autism until age   says she knew that otherwise  her classmates would think she was strange and her teachers would punish her for distracting others. The adults in the survey described an imaginative store of tools they call upon in different situations to avoid pain and gain acceptance. If  for example  someone has trouble starting a conversation  she might practice smiling first  Lai says  or prepare jokes as an icebreaker. Many women develop a repertoire of personas for different audiences.  Jennifer  says  she  studies other peopleâs behavior and learns gestures or phrases that  to  her   seem to project confidence;  she  often practices in front of a mirror.
Before a job interview   she  writes down the questions  she  thinks  she  will be asked  and then writes down and memorizes the answers.  She  has also committed to memory four anecdotes  she  can tell about how  she  met a challenging deadline. The survey found that women on the spectrum often create similar rules and scripts for themselves for having conversations. To avoid speaking too much about a restricted interest  they may rehearse stories about other topics. To hide the full extent of  her  anxiety when  she  is âshaking insideâ because  say  an event is not starting on time  Swearman has prepared  herself  to say  âIâm upset right now. I canât focus; I canât talk to  you  right now.â Some women say that  in particular  they put in a great deal of effort into disguising their stimming. âFor many people  stimming may be a way to self-soothe  self-regulate  and relieve anxiety  among other things â Lai says. And yet these motionsâwhich can include flapping hands  spinning  scratching  and head bangingâcan also readily âoutâ these people as having autism. IgelstrÃ¶m and her colleagues interviewed  people  mostly women and a few trans people  about camouflaging their stimming. Many of the participants had self-diagnosed  but  women have an official autism diagnosis. Nearly  percent of the participants had tried to implement strategies to make stimming less detectable  IgelstrÃ¶m says. The most common method is redirecting their energy into less visible muscle movements  such as sucking and clenching their teeth or tensing and relaxing their thigh muscles. The majority also try to channel their need to stim into more socially acceptable movements  such as tapping a pen  doodling  or playing with objects under the table. Many try to confine their stimming to times when they are alone or in a safe place  such as with family. IgelstrÃ¶m found that a few individuals try to prevent stimming altogether by way of sheer will or by restraining themselvesâby sitting on their hands  for example.","['Except for her family and closest friends  no one in  Jennifer â\x80\x99s various circles knows that  she  is on the spectrum.

British explorer Benedict Allen  has been flown out of the jungle in Papua New Guinea and is expected home on Sunday.
 Mr Allen  became disorientated with fever while trying to reach a remote tribe and missed  his  flight home  the BBC's Frank Gardner said.
The -year-old had taken no means of communication with  him   prompting  his  family to mount a search on Monday.
 He  was spotted ""alive and well"" on Thursday near a remote airstrip.
 Mr Allen   who had been looked after by Christian missionaries after trekking large distances  was flown by helicopter to the Papua New Guinea capital of Port Moresby on Friday.
"" Benedict  looks forward to being reunited with  his  family and friends but will need some time to get back to full health "" the statement added.
"" He  would like to send thanks for all the kind messages  he  has received.""
 Mr Allen 's wife  Lenka  told the Daily Mail: ""It is such a relief. I'm so happy  it's amazing.""

Democrats are shedding contributions from Hollywood mogul and liberal political donor  Harvey Weinstein  after  he  was accused of serial sexual harassment this week.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and several colleagues will send money  Weinstein  gave their campaign funds to womenâs charities and groups that combat sexual violence  their offices confirmed by email Friday.
âThe Democratic Party condemns all forms of sexual harassment and assault â DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in an emailed statement. â We  hope that Republicans will do the same as  we  mark one year since the release of a tape showing President Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women followed by more than a dozen women who came forward to detail similar experiences of assault and harassment.â
Democrats began giving up  Weinstein âs donations after the New York Times reported Thursday that  he  had faced allegations of sexual harassment over a period of nearly three decades and reached at least eight settlements with accusers. The Republican National Committee and the GOP opposition-research-group America Rising PAC had pounced on the news and called for Democrats to denounce  Weinstein  and let go of  his  contributions.
âThere is no excuse for these Democrats to hold onto  Weinstein âs campaign contributions for a minute longer. That it has taken them this long to say anything  is by itself a disgrace â America Rising said Friday in an unsigned statement.
 Weinstein  has also made donations to Hillary Clinton  former president Barack Obama  state Democratic parties and liberal political action groups  according to campaign finance records. After the Times published its piece   Weinstein  apologized  threatened to sue the paper and said  he  planned to take a leave of absence.

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III filed new charges on Feb.  against  former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business partner  Rick Gates . Here is what you need to know. (Melissa Macaya Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
According to a criminal information â a document filed earlier Friday with the permission of the defendant â Gates conspired to defraud the United States regarding the money he and his business partner Paul Manafort earned while working for a political party in Ukraine and lied to the FBI in a Feb.    interview about a  meeting between Manafort  a lobbyist  and a congressman.
That FBI interview came as Gates was trying to negotiate a plea deal. In the interview  Gates claimed there had been no discussion of Ukraine at the  meeting  when in fact  Gates and  Manafort  prepared a report detailing the Ukrainian discussions  according to the criminal information.
Gatesâs plea raises the pressure on  Manafort   the former Trump campaign chairman. Both men were hit with a -count indictment in Virginia on Thursday  following an earlier -count indictment of the pair in the District back in October.
 Manafort  issued a statement Friday expressing surprise but still vowing to beat the charges.
âNotwithstanding that Rick Gates pleaded today  I continue to maintain my innocence â  Manafort  said. âI had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence. For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.â
The latest indictment of Gates and Manafort does not involve conduct at the Trump campaign  although the conduct in question continued during that period. Instead  the special counsel accused the men of lying on their income-tax returns and conspiring to commit bank fraud to get loans as part an elaborate scheme to use their income from a Ukrainian political party to buy properties  evade taxes and support  Manafort âs lavish lifestyle.
According to the court document submitted with Gatesâs agreement   Manafort  laundered more than $ million between  and   and Gates transferred more than $ million to accounts he controlled during that time.","['Special counsel Robert S.

4510,test,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry  says  he  thinks using fossil fuels can help prevent sexual assault.
 Perry  said Thursday that using fossil fuels to power electricity can help villages in Africa and other developing regions.  He  said during a recent visit to Africa  a young girl told  him  electricity was important to her because she has to read by the light of a fire with noxious fumes.
Speaking at an event sponsored by Axios and NBC News   Perry  said electricity also was important ""from the standpoint of sexual assault. When the lights are on  when you have light that shines the righteousness  if you will  on those types of acts.""
From the standpoint ""of how you really affect people's lives  fossil fuels ... play a role in that ""  Perry  said. ""I happen to think it's going to play a positive role.""
 Perry 's remark comes amid an uproar over sexual-assault allegations against film mogul Harvey Weinstein that has spread to other industries and politics.
 Perry  has been challenging what  he  calls an inaccurate narrative pushed by environmentalists that fossil fuels are harmful because they contribute to climate change.  He  says fossil fuels such as oil  coal and natural gas foster economic development and jobs and are an important strategic asset for the United States.
 Perry  and President Donald Trump are promoting increased domestic energy production as part of a strategy to achieve U.S. ""energy dominance"" in the global market.
Michael Brune  executive director of the Sierra Club  the nation's largest environmental group  called  Perry 's comments offensive.
""It was already clear that  Rick Perry  is unfit to lead the Department of Energy  but to suggest that fossil fuel development will decrease sexual assault is not only blatantly untrue  it is an inexcusable attempt to minimize a serious and pervasive issue "" Brune said in a statement.

4513,test,"It's strange to look back on it now  as the U.S. president scolds the NFL for a perceived lack of patriotism  but when then- quarterback  Colin Kaepernick's  decision not to stand for the national anthem first draw attention last year  the football world wasn't impressed.
Everyone from superstar quarterback Drew Brees to Kaepernick's old coach Jim Harbaugh to  legend Jerry Rice clucked their tongues about his supposed disrespect for the flag. A report months after  Kaepernick  had opted into free agency claimed some team executives had come to ""genuinely hate"" him.
A year after that first protest   Kaepernick  remains exiled from the league in what a growing pile of evidence suggests is a politically motivated blackballing. His absence loomed larger than ever across Sunday's games  which were the first to follow Donald Trump's harsh  misguided criticism of the NFL.
After two days of sometimes-profane attacks from the nation's highest office aimed at high-profile black athletes  dozens of players and team staff followed  Kaepernick 's lead. An early London game started things off  with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens both kneeling or linking arms during the pre-game national anthem. It was an act of protest that notably included Jags owner Shad Khan.
Also NFL:  Colin Kaepernick   not employed. â Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September

4514,test,"Roy Moore is the  Steve Bannon  project in a nutshell.
For the former Trump operative  the Alabama Senate candidateâs tattered credibility is a feature  not a bug. If Moore had well-considered political and legal views  good judgment and a sterling reputation  heâd almost by definition be part of the establishment that  Bannon  so loathes. Since Moore has none of those things  heâs nearly an ideal representative of the Bannon insurgency.
Events in Alabama make it clear that  Bannon âs dime-store Leninism â burn everything down  including perhaps the Republican Senate majority â comes at a considerable cost. In this project  the truth doesnât matter  ethics donât matter  and standards donât matter. Being anti-establishment is an escape clause from personal responsibility  and #war means proudly defending the indefensible.
Once youâve devoted time and energy building up the career of white nationalist fellow traveler Milo Yiannopoulos the way  Bannon  did at Breitbart  thereâs nothing that you arenât willing to do.
Itâs no accident  Bannon  ended up joined at the hip to the one Republican in the state of Alabama who might be capable of losing a Senate race.
 Bannon  went out of  his  way to associate  himself  with Moore  to make the former judge â twice jettisoned from the stateâs highest court â a poster boy for his style of politics  and to call him a ârighteous man.â
There are two options in terms of  Bannon âs role in Alabama.
If heâs the Svengali he portrays himself as  heâs falling down on the job. It appears  Bannon  didnât do thorough oppo on  his  own candidate. The two Breitbart hatchet men whom  Bannon  sent to Alabama to discredit Mooreâs accusers have produced nothing of consequence.
Then  thereâs the option that  Bannon  is simply a glorified bystander  which is consistent with the fact that Moore wouldâve almost certainly won the primary with or without his support.
 Bannon âs reputation  of course  depends on  his  role as President Trumpâs chief strategist.  He  was onto the Trump phenomenon early and  he   along with Kellyanne Conway and David Bossie  provided a stabilizing influence on the  Trump  campaign in the summer of .
The genius in the Trump operation  though  was nât Bannon ; it was  Trump   whose power as a communicator  gut-level political instincts and celebrity overcame  his  manifest failings in a race against a Democratic opponent who proved one of the worst candidates in modern presidential history.
 Donald Trump  was  Donald Trump  long before  Bannon  showed up  and  sure enough   he âs been  Donald Trump  since  Bannon  left the White House. (Earlier this year  I thought  Bannon  might help anchor the White House to the right  but that gave  him  too much credit.)
 Bannon  was fired by the president because  Trump  got sick of hearing in the press how the operative was responsible for  his  success  and because what  Bannon  mostly did all day long was leak to reporters.
Itâs a testament to Bannonâs shape-shifting that he wiggles out of his status as a proven leaker  when that is considered the supreme act of perfidy by  Trump  loyalists. ( Bannon  administered the coup de grace to  himself  within the White House by calling a liberal reporter out of the blue and not stipulating it was off the record.)

Ultimately   Bannon  is a barnacle on the  Trump  brand  although one that canât get his story straight.

4515,test,"Women from Hollywood to Washington are working to end sexual harassment in the workplace with movements like #MeToo and Time's Up. And now   Meryl Streep  is calling on Melania Trump to speak out. That's right   Melania â Meryl  is lookin' at  you .
In a new interview   Meryl Streep  and Tom Hanks  both stars of The Post  spoke with The New York Times about Donald Trump  #MeToo  and Harvey Weinstein.
When  Streep  was asked about  her  role in the #MeToo movement   Streep  said ""I donât want to hear about the silence of  me . I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump. I want to hear from  her .  She  has so much thatâs valuable to say. And so does Ivanka. I want  her  to speak now.""
 Streep  is perceived by some as Hollywood's moral compass and upstanding citizen-in-chief  especially after  her   Golden Globes speech in which  she  called for transparency  empathy  respect  and inclusion  in the face of a Trump presidency.
However  towards the end of    Streep  drew criticism about  her  advocacy  or perceived lack there of  in the industry. After Harvey Weinstein's history of sexual abuse was revealed  Rose McGowan  a street artist  and others on the internet criticized  Meryl Streep  for what they saw as  her  initial silence on the scandal  and what has since been interpreted as complicity with Weinstein's actions. ( Streep  has worked on several movies with Weinstein in the past including The Irony Lady and August: Osage County  and has frequently appeared with him in photos and in public).
 Streep  said that  she  did not know about the rape and sexual abuse  and strongly condemned Weinstein in the press after the Weinstein reports broke (though not immediately; in the Times interview   Streep  said  she  ""went home deep into my own life"" before finding out people were waiting for  her  to weigh in days later).
When the allegations against Weinstein continued to pour out   Streep  released a strong condemnation of  his  behavior to the Huffington Post.
But that statement didn't quash the criticisms. In a now deleted tweet  McGowan wrote about  Streep : ""YOUR SILENCE is THE problem."" Around the same time  posters of  Streep  alongside Weinstein emblazoned with the words ""She Knew"" appeared around Los Angeles.  Streep  again responded in the Huffington Post ""I didnât know. I donât tacitly approve of rape. I didnât know. I donât like young women being assaulted. I didnât know this was happening.""

Given the backlash  it's understandable that  Streep  attempted to turn the tables when the Times reporter asked  her  about #MeToo.
But pivoting the conversation to Melania and Ivanka is wishful thinking. Melania is probably best known for  her  elusiveness and staged public persona.  Her  statements on social media are infrequent and rote.  She  has yet to take a public stance more substantive than ""bullying is bad."" And the last time  she  addressed sexual misconduct  it was to defend  her  husband for his ""grab 'em by the pussy"" statements.
Ivanka is a different story.  She  recently spoke out about sexual harassment in the workplace at an appearance in Japan  and strongly criticized alleged pedophile and the losing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (which Trump was reportedly not too pleased about). But like so much of Ivanka's work on issues that concern women   her  actions on behalf of  her  father â like supporting his repeal of an Obama-era initiative that aimed to combat the gender pay gap â speak louder than  her  too-polished words.","[""Women from Hollywood to Washington are working to end sexual harassment in the workplace with movements like #MeToo and Time's Up.

4516,test,"On Dec.   the ''RAC '' as the committee is called  will begin a public inquiry into  Jesse 's death  as well as the safety of adenovirus  which has been used in roughly one-quarter of all gene-therapy clinical trials. The Penn scientists will report on their preliminary results  and investigators  who at the RAC's request have submitted thousands of pages of patient safety data to the committee  will discuss the side effects of adenovirus. Among them will be researchers from the Schering-Plough Corporation  which was running two experiments in advanced liver cancer patients that used methods similar to Penn's. Enrollment in those trials was suspended by the Food and Drug Administration after  Jesse 's death. The company  under pressure from the RAC  has since released information showing that some patients experienced serious side effects  including changes in liver function and blood-cell counts  mental confusion and nausea; two experienced minor strokes  although one had a history of them. Once all the data on adenovirus are analyzed at the Dec.  meeting  the RAC may recommend restrictions on its use  which will almost certainly slow down some aspects of gene-therapy research.
The meeting will be important for another reason: it will mark an unprecedented public airing of information about the safety of gene therapy -- precisely the kind of sharing the RAC has unsuccessfully sought in the past. Officials say gene therapy has claimed no lives besides  Jesse 's. But since  his  death  there have been news reports that other patients died during the course of experiments -- from their diseases  as opposed to the therapy -- and that the scientists involved did not report those deaths to the RAC  as is required. This has created a growing cloud of suspicion over gene therapy  raising questions about whether other scientists may have withheld information that could have prevented  Jesse 's death. That question cannot be answered until all the data are analyzed. But one thing is certain: four years after the field was rocked by Varmus's highly critical evaluation  it is now being rocked again  this time over an issue more fundamental than efficacy -- safety.
No one  perhaps  is more acutely aware of gene therapy's broken promise than Mark Batshaw  the pediatrician who proposed the experiment that cost  Jesse Gelsinger   his  life.
At   Batshaw  who left the University of Pennsylvania last year for Children's National Medical Center  in Washington  is tall and gangly with slightly stooped shoulders and a shy smile that gives  him  the air of an awkward schoolboy  which  he  once was. As a child  Batshaw struggled with hyperactivity:  he  didn't read until the third grade; in the fourth   his  teacher grew so irritated at  his  constant chatter that she stuck  his  chair out in the hall. The experience has left  him  with a soft spot for developmentally disabled children  which is how  he  has become one of the world's foremost experts in urea-cycle disorders  among them OTC deficiency.

 Paul Gelsinger  was also enthusiastic. A trim -year-old with intense blue eyes   Gelsinger  who makes his living as a handyman   gained custody of his four children nine years ago  when he divorced their mother  who suffers from manic depression. He had been having some difficulty with Jesse then; the boy was in the midst of an adolescent rebellion and was refusing to take his medicine. ''I said: 'Wow  Jess  they're working on your disorder. Maybe they'll come up with a cure.'''
Jesse's was not a typical case of OTC deficiency: his mutation appears to have occurred spontaneously in the womb. His disease having been diagnosed when he was   Jesse was what scientists call a mosaic -- a small portion of his cells produced the missing enzyme. When he watched what he ate and took his medicine  he was fine. But one day last December   Paul Gelsinger  arrived home to find  his  son curled up on the couch. He had been vomiting uncontrollably  a sign   Paul  knew  that Jesse's ammonia was rising. Jesse landed in the hospital  comatose and on life support. When he recovered  he never missed another pill.
On June   the day Jesse turned   the Gelsingers -- Paul  Mickie and the children -- flew to Philadelphia to see  Paul 's family. They played tourists  visiting the Liberty Bell and the Rocky statue  where Jesse was photographed  fists raised  a picture that would circulate in the newspapers after his death. On the   they went to the University of Pennsylvania  where they met Raper  the surgeon  who explained the experiment and did blood and liver-function tests to see if Jesse was eligible. He was  and his treatment was scheduled for the fall. Jesse would be the youngest patient enrolled.
On Sept.   Jesse returned to Philadelphia  this time alone. He took one duffel bag full of clothes and another full of wrestling videos.  Paul Gelsinger  planned to fly in a week later for the liver biopsy  which  he  considered the trial's most serious risk.
That night  Jesse was sick to his stomach and spiked a fever  . degrees. Raper was not particularly surprised: other patients had experienced the same reaction.  Paul Gelsinger  called;  he  and Jesse talked briefly  exchanging I love yous. Those were the last words they ever spoke.
 Paul Gelsinger  had booked a red-eye flight. When  he  arrived in the surgical intensive care unit at  Wednesday morning  Raper and Batshaw told  him  that dialysis had brought Jesse's ammonia level down to  but that other complications were developing.  He  was hyperventilating  which would increase the level of ammonia in  his  brain. They wanted to paralyze  his  muscles and induce a deeper coma  so that a ventilator could breathe for  him .  Gelsinger  gave consent. Then  he  put on scrubs  gloves and a mask and went in to see  his  son.
By Wednesday afternoon  Jesse seemed to be stabilizing. Batshaw went back to Washington.  Paul  felt comfortable enough to meet  his  brother for dinner. But later that night Jesse worsened again. His lungs grew stiff; the doctors were giving him  percent oxygen  but not enough of it was getting to his bloodstream. They consulted a liver-transplant team and learned that Jesse was not a good candidate. Raper was beside himself. He consulted with Batshaw and Wilson  and they decided to take an extraordinary step  a procedure known as ECMO  for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  essentially an external lung that filters the blood  removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen. It had been tried on only   people before  Raper says. Only half had survived.
The next day  Thursday  Sept.   Hurricane Floyd slammed into the East Coast.  Mickie Gelsinger  flew in from Tucson just before the airport closed. ( Pattie Gelsinger  Jesse's  mother  was being treated in a psychiatric facility and was unable to leave.) Batshaw spent the day trapped outside Baltimore on an Amtrak train. He ran down his cell phone calling Raper; when it went dead  he persuaded another passenger to lend him his. The ECMO  Raper reported  appeared to be working. But then another problem cropped up: Jesse's kidneys stopped making urine. ''He was sliding into multiple-organ-system failure '' Raper says.
That night  at his hotel   Paul Gelsinger  couldn't sleep.  He  left  his  wife a note and walked the half mile to the Penn medical center to see Jesse. The boy was bloated beyond recognition; even his ears were swollen shut.  Gelsinger  noticed blood in Jesse's urine  an indication   he  knew  that the kidneys were shutting down. How can anybody   he  thought  survive this?
On the morning of Friday the   a test showed that Jesse was brain dead.  Paul Gelsinger  didn't need to be told: ''I knew it already.''  He  called for a chaplain to hold a bedside service  with prayers for the removal of life support.
The room was crowded with equipment and people:  of  Paul 's  siblings came in  plus an array of doctors and nurses. Raper and Batshaw  shellshocked and exhausted  stood in the back. The chaplain anointed Jesse's forehead with oil  then read the Lord's Prayer. The doctors fought back tears. When the intensive-care specialist flipped two toggle switches  one to turn off the ventilator and the other to turn off the ECMO machine  Raper stepped forward. He checked the heart-rate monitor  watched the line go flat and noted the time: : p.m. He put his stethoscope to Jesse's chest  more out of habit than necessity  and pronounced the death official.

''We'll figure this out.''","[""On Dec.   the ''RAC '' as the committee is called  will begin a public inquiry into  Jesse 's death  as well as the safety of adenovirus  which has been used in roughly one-quarter of all gene-therapy clinical trials. The Penn scientists will report on their preliminary results  and investigators  who at the RAC's request have submitted thousands of pages of patient safety data to the committee  will discuss the side effects of adenovirus. Among them will be researchers from the Schering-Plough Corporation  which was running two experiments in advanced liver cancer patients that used methods similar to Penn's. Enrollment in those trials was suspended by the Food and Drug Administration after  Jesse 's death. The company  under pressure from the RAC  has since released information showing that some patients experienced serious side effects  including changes in liver function and blood-cell counts  mental confusion and nausea; two experienced minor strokes  although one had a history of them.

But since  his  death  there have been news reports that other patients died during the course of experiments -- from their diseases  as opposed to the therapy -- and that the scientists involved did not report those deaths to the RAC  as is required. This has created a growing cloud of suspicion over gene therapy  raising questions about whether other scientists may have withheld information that could have prevented  Jesse 's death. That question cannot be answered until all the data are analyzed.

âIâm a fan of the McChicken â  Metcalf  told the Lansing State Journal  âIâve always loved them.â
The chemical engineering major started preparing for the eating marathon the weekend before by working out aggressively.  He  tried to burn as many calories as  he  could since  McChicken sandwiches â with shredded lettuce  mayonnaise  toasted bun and chicken patty â equals about   calories  or roughly  times the recommended amount of calories an average adult male should be consuming daily.
 Metcalf  started  his  experiment at : am Monday  working  his  way through the ten sandwiches  he  had purchased the night before.
The first four were easy  the Lansing State Journal reported. But  Metcalf  soon found  his  downfall.
âToo much mayo makes a man weak â  Metcalf  said. âIt was really hard to eat that amount of mayo.â
Part of the challenge is to eat the McChicken sandwiches unadulterated  so  Metcalf  pressed on  mayonnaise and all.
 Metcalf  kept track of  his  progress on Snapchat  which quickly amassed more than   views when  he  uploaded it to Michigan State Universityâs specific Snapchat story.
The videos consisted of  Metcalf  ordering and eating the sandwiches  but it also included tips for how to get McChicken sandwiches crispy after refrigeration. One includes pan-frying the patty  or throwing the sandwich in the oven on low heat.

4518,test,"Inspired by national outrage over  the Larry Nassar sex abuse case   a bill that would make  it  a federal crime for Olympic sports officials to fail to report suspected child abuse to the authorities passed through Congress on Tuesday  advancing to President Trumpâs desk.
 The bill  was first proposed last March by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and passed the Senate in November. A companion bill overwhelmingly passed the House on Monday evening  and the Senate approved the final version unanimously by voice vote Tuesday afternoon.
In a news conference Tuesday  several victims of  Nassar  and their advocates celebrated the billâs passage  while expressing hope the renewed interest by lawmakers in  the case  maintains momentum  and that proposed independent inquiries into any culpability for Nassarâs crimes by officials at USA Gymnastics  the United States Olympic Committee  and Michigan State University come to fruition.
âWhile we celebrate today â¦ there is still work to be done â said Jeanette Antolin  a former Team USA gymnast from the  who has asserted  Nassar  abused her  like many others  under the guise of medical treatment. âThere must be a thorough investigation â¦ Timeâs not on our side; we must act now.â

The House Energy and Commerce Committee has sent letters to Michigan State  USA Gymnastics and the USOC asking how the organizations responded to prior reports of abuse by Nassar  the former longtime Michigan State and USA Gymnastics sports physician accused by more than  girls and women of sexual abuse. Multiple women have claimed they raised complaints about  Nassar  to a coach and two trainers at Michigan State  where  he  worked as an assistant professor and sports physician in a campus clinic  as far back as   but those accused of ignoring complaints have denied these allegations.
No victims have come forward asserting officials with the USOC  which oversees Olympic sports organizations  ignored a complaint against  Nassar . USA Gymnastics has said it first became aware of complaints against  Nassar  in June   and five weeks later  the organization reported  Nassar  to the FBI.
Among others speaking at Tuesdayâs news conference were Jamie Dantzscher  a  Olympian and  Nassar  victim  and Nancy Hogshead-Makar  an Olympic gold medalist swimmer and civil rights attorney who has called for stronger protections for abuse victims in Olympic sports organizations for years.
âOne week before  started speaking  nothing was going to happen â¦ This is what it took. It took  victims of sexual assault telling their stories â said Hogshead-Makar  referring to the outpouring of interest and outrage  both nationally and by members of Congress  that resulted from the extraordinary seven-day sentencing hearing for  Nassar  this month  in which  girls and women confronted  him  with their accounts of abuse. Nassar    who pleaded guilty to  sexual assault counts  faces a  to  year prison term for those crimes  as well as a -year sentence for federal child pornography crimes.
 Larry Nassar  has another sentencing hearing. Fifty-seven women are expected to speak.

BERLIN  â Polish President Andrzej Duda  signed a law Tuesday banning people from accusing Poland of Holocaust atrocities committed by the Nazis and from referring to concentration camps as ""Polish death camps"" -- heightening tensions with the United States and Israel  which have criticized the measure.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday that he was âdisappointedâ in  Duda 's decision. âEnactment of this law adversely affects freedom of speech and academic inquiry . . . We believe that open debate  scholarship  and education are the best means of countering misleading speech â Tillerson said.
 Duda  also announced Tuesday that  he  would ask the countryâs Constitutional Tribunal to review the bill to check whether it complies with Polandâs fundamental rights  such as freedom of speech  potentially opening the door to amendments.
Responding to the news of  Duda 's decision  Israel's Foreign Ministry expressed hope that the constitutional review would prompt âchanges and corrections.â But the law is expected to take effect before the tribunal would be able to issue any clarifications  and the independence of the judges themselves.
In a speech on Tuesday   Duda  used less provocative rhetoric. â do not deny that there were cases of huge wickednessâ on the part of some Poles toward Jews   he  said  according to the AP. But  Duda  stressed that âthere was no systemic way in which Poles took part inâ Nazi crimes.","['Poland\'s President Andrzej Duda  said Feb.   he  will sign a bill  he  claims protects  his  nation\'s ""dignity"" and ""historical truth.""

 Trump  used some of  his  most polarizing language when lamenting crime from MS- and other gangs  which  he  blamed on âopen borders.â  He  sought to repurpose the term âdreamerâ by saying American citizens have seen their economic prospects dimmed and personal safety put at risk because of illegal immigration.
âThe United States is a compassionate nation â  he  said. â. . . But as president of the United States  my highest loyalty  my greatest compassion and my constant concern is for Americaâs children  Americaâs struggling workers and Americaâs forgotten communities.â  He  added  in an apparent contrast with undocumented immigrants  âAmericans are dreamers  too.â
 Trump  has set a March deadline to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  which has protected those who applied from deportation  and lawmakers are scrambling to come up with an alternative that can survive the political crosscurrents of both chambers.
The speech came at a crucial moment when  the president  faces a number of challenges: historically bad approval ratings for a chief executive at this point in  his  term  an investigation of Russian meddling in the  election hanging over  his  administration and midterm elections ahead in which Democrats are expected to make significant gains in Congress.
 Trump  pointed to that achievement â which  he  again falsely claimed is âthe biggest tax cuts and reforms in American historyâ â as contributing to a resurgent economy.  He  ticked off growth in jobs  wages  small-business confidence and a stock market that âsmashed one record after another  gaining $ trillion in value.â
While Republicans cheered throughout  Democrats sat stonily. When  Trump  said the unemployment rate among African Americans was at a record low  for example  members of the Congressional Black Caucus refrained from applauding.
To give their official response  Democratic leaders picked third-term Rep. Joe Kennedy (Mass.)  who marks the third generation of the Kennedy clan to serve in Congress.  He  spoke from a technical-school auto shop in Fall River  Mass.
Other Democrats said  Trump  was particularly divisive in  his  discussion of immigrants and in tying them to crime. âIf you were hoping for a unifying speech tonight  you got the opposite â said Sen.

 Trump  made only passing reference to the devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria  the federal governmentâs response to which has been widely criticized as inadequate and slow.
 Trump  turned even more than presidents typically do to the stories of guests  seated in the gallery box of first lady Melania Trump  to put human faces on his policies and build the narrative arc of his speech. A president so often preoccupied with self-adulation shone the spotlight on ordinary citizens.
Near the end of the speech  as he talked about the nuclear threat of North Korea â which has escalated under his watch amid heated rhetoric â  Trump  singled out the tragedy of Otto Warmbier  the University of Virginia student who was detained in North Korea and died just after returning home to the United States. In one of the eveningâs emotional high points   Trump  singled out Warmbierâs parents  who sat teary-eyed in the gallery  as âpowerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world.â
Though  he  did not use âLittle Rocket Man â  his  provocative nickname for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un   he  spoke with toughness and resolve about the threat across the Pacific.

She was led by her coaches into believing Nassar    a former University of Michigan sports doctor  was a ""miracle worker  who could fix anything.""

Speaking directly to  Nassar   she said  ""What you did to me was twisted. You manipulated me and my family. How dare you.""
She asked Aguilina to give  Nassar  the maximum sentence.

4526,test,"The Resilience Of  Victoria Williams
 Victoria Williams  has one of the most distinctive voices in American rock.  She 's also one of its most unusual lyricists.
 The singer  can't remember a time when  she  didn't sing.
""I kind of unconsciously sang before I'd go to bed. I would be singing to where my brother would knock on the wall and say  'Shut up ' "" Williams  tells NPR's Alex Cohen.
Eventually   she  grew a bit more conscious of  her  talent and started performing with local bands around  her  hometown of Forbing  Louisiana. But  Williams  never really thought of it as a career â until one night  when  she  played at a gig at a deer camp for a gathering of hunters.
""The band went on break and I went and I sang a song "" says  Williams . ""And this hunter came up and  he  says  'I'll give you a hundred dollars if you sing another song.'""
Soon after   Williams  began writing songs like ""Happy Come Home "" a tune inspired by one of her neighbors who lost her dog.
""It touches me because of the lyric  'Happy come home.' Maybe it's not even a dog... maybe it's just happiness "" says  Williams .
From there   Williams  built a loyal following on simple songs that strike a deeper chord.
""To me  empathy is the main instrument of our very existence... The ordinary human condition in all of its comedy and tragedy â and she had all of that in a pronounced way "" says pianist and composer Van Dyke Parks  who has worked with such notable artists as The Beach Boys   and Skrillex and arranged  Williams '  debut album.
That album caught the attention of the famed filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker  who had already made documentaries about Bob Dylan and the epochal Monterey Pop Festival. Pennebaker shot a short film about  Williams  and her music.
""I was like on the  show "" says  Williams . ""All of a sudden my hands were numb and I couldn't play the guitar  so I'm just standing there sitting and singing a capella. So  his  manager said  'You've got to go to the hospital and figure out what's wrong with you.'""
 Williams  was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis  a degenerative disease of the central nervous system. She had to stop performing to regain her health and  before long  the singer was overwhelmed by medical bills. Luckily   Williams  had earned some fans through an appearance years before on a cable access show in New York City.
The couple wound up befriending  Williams  and when the singer fell ill. ""We felt this immediate need to help her...and I think a lot of people felt that way.""
Reed says it wasn't too hard to get some people to record  Williams ' songs for a benefit album Reed helped organize  Sweet Relief: A Benefit for  Victoria Williams  featured a dozen artists including Pearl Jam  Lucinda Williams  and Reed's husband.  Victoria Williams  says  she 'll never forget the first time  she  heard it.
Sweet Relief helped bring  Williams ' music to a much wider audience and raised so much money  she  wound up with a surplus.

4527,test,"Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren on Thursday sentenced  Weier  to  years in a psychiatric institution  retroactive to the date of the  crime.
 Anissa Weier     pleaded guilty in August to being a party to attempted second-degree intentional homicide  but  she  claimed  she  wasn't responsible for  her  actions because  she  was mentally ill. In September  a jury agreed.
Weier and Morgan Geyser lured Payton Leutner into a wooded park in Waukesha  a Milwaukee suburb  in . Geyser stabbed Leutner  times while  Weier  urged  her  on  according to investigators. Leutner survived after she crawled out of the woods to a path where a passing bicyclist found her.
 Both Weier  and Geyser told detectives  they  felt  they  had to kill Leutner to become Slender Man's ""proxies "" or servants  and protect their families from him. All three girls were  years old at the time.
 Weier  spoke to the court Thursday and apologized for  her  actions.
""I want everyone involved to know I deeply regret everything that happened that day  "" Weier  said. ""I know nothing I say is going to make this right  nothing I say is going to fix what I broke.""
 Weier  said  she  holds  herself  accountable and said  ""I'll do whatever I have to do to make sure this doesn't happen again.""

The hubs are considered so successful by the government they have been expanded nationwide   Shaw   professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Manchester  told Reuters.
 Shaw  said determining who might be a potential attacker from mental health problems alone was not really feasible and fraught with problems  but  she  said it might be possible to ascertain the characteristics of people most likely to be at risk and ensure they got appropriate help.
âThat doesnât mean you canât manage the risks. Trying to nip it in the bud  thatâs all you can do. But thatâs good if you can achieve that  itâs going a long way â said  Shaw .
Police officers say they have struggled in the past to reach medical practitioners when they had concerns about some people and  Shaw  said the pilot was designed to address those worries.
 Shaw  acknowledged more work was needed on the outcomes of their mental health interventions under the Prevent pilot programs to determine what made a difference.
âWeâre attempting to try and get at that. Is it completely to do with their mental illness  half to do with it  or not at all?â said  Shaw .","['â\x80\x9cAnecdotally  I am surprised that there appears to be a much higher prevalence of people with mental health problems than you would expect â\x80\x9d said  Professor Jennifer Shaw   the mental health lead for Greater Manchester Police  referring to the people  her  team had dealt with since the pilot was launched.', 'The hubs are considered so successful by the government they have been expanded nationwide   Shaw   professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Manchester  told Reuters.', ' Shaw  said determining who might be a potential attacker from mental health problems alone was not really feasible and fraught with problems  but  she  said it might be possible to ascertain the characteristics of people most likely to be at risk and ensure they got appropriate help.', 'â\x80\x9cThat doesnâ\x80\x99t mean you canâ\x80\x99t manage the risks.
